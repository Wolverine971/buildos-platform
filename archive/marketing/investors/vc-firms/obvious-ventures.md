## Summary Score: üü° **Lower Priority / Alternative Target**

Obvious Ventures presents unclear alignment for BuildOS given limited visible portfolio activity in productivity software and economic health focus that appears more financial services oriented. While mission-driven approach is appealing, the fit requires significant validation.

**Success Probability**: Uncertain (limited portfolio alignment)
**Strategic Value**: Medium (consumer platform expertise if aligned)
**Timeline**: Research phase required to validate fit

**Recommendation**: Consider as lower priority investment target, but explore potential advisory or strategic relationship given Evan Williams' consumer platform expertise and mission-driven approach.

**Alternative Value**: Evan Williams could provide valuable insights on consumer platform scaling, user experience design, and positioning productivity tools as positive societal impact - potentially more valuable as advisor than investor for BuildOS's current trajectory.
