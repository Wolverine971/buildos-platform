# Paige Craig (Outlander VC) - Warm Introduction Email Template

## Investor Context

- **Fund**: Outlander VC (Systematic founder evaluation)
- **Background**: Marine Corps → Defense Contractor → 38-point founder framework
- **Investment Thesis**: Character, execution, vision, intelligence evaluation
- **Connection Strength**: 90% - Strong military + systematic execution alignment

### Specific Common Ground Opportunities

- **Marine Corps Values**: Shared understanding of Semper Fidelis, honor, courage, commitment
- **Combat Experience**: Both deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan - understand life-or-death decision making
- **Entrepreneurial Grit**: Military → Civilian entrepreneur transition challenges and mindset
- **Systematic Assessment**: Military training in evaluating personnel under pressure
- **Mission Accomplishment**: Focus on completing objectives regardless of obstacles
- **Leadership Philosophy**: Leading by example and earning respect through competence
- **Risk Assessment**: Military training in calculated risk-taking and contingency planning
- **Global Perspective**: Deployment experience and understanding of international operations

### How Paige Likely Feels About Current Market (Late 2024/Early 2025)

**Founder Quality Decline**: "Too many founders lack the grit and character needed for real building. The easy money era produced entrepreneurs who fold at the first sign of adversity. Military founders understand that setbacks are part of the mission."

**AI Hype Skepticism**: "Most AI startups are built by people who've never been in high-pressure situations. They don't understand operational reality. Military founders know the difference between technology that works in demos versus real-world environments."

**Systematic Evaluation Necessity**: "In this market, investors need military-grade evaluation frameworks. Surface-level pattern matching isn't enough. You need systematic assessment of character, intelligence, vision, and execution capability."

**Market Correction Opportunity**: "This downturn separates real founders from tourists. Military founders have inherent advantages - they've been through adversity before. They know how to execute with limited resources and unclear intelligence."

**Long-term Building Focus**: "The founders raising now are the ones building for the long term, not quick exits. Military founders naturally think in terms of mission accomplishment, not exit strategies. That's exactly what this market needs."

**Evidence-Based Investing**: "Too many investors rely on gut feel and social proof. Military founders understand documentation, metrics, and proof of execution. They come prepared with evidence, not just stories."

**Subject**: Marine-Inspired Systematic Execution: BuildOS for Entrepreneurs

Hi Paige,

Your 38-point founder evaluation framework caught my attention - it mirrors the systematic assessment approach that made me successful in both military service and at Curri, the YC-backed logistics company where I built integration systems serving millions of deliveries.

I'm reaching out because I'm building something that embodies the "by any means necessary" dedication you look for: BuildOS, an AI-native productivity platform that turns entrepreneurial chaos into systematic execution.

Like the discipline that took you from $10K in Baghdad to $300M with Lincoln Group, BuildOS helps founders apply military-grade operational thinking to their daily execution. We're not adding AI features to existing tools - we're rebuilding productivity from first principles.

I'm not actively fundraising at the moment, but I'd love to share what we're building and get your thoughts on systematic approaches to entrepreneurial execution. Your perspective on founder evaluation would be incredibly valuable.

Would you be open to a brief conversation? Happy to keep it focused on the systematic execution principles rather than any investment discussion.

Best,
[Name]

Military Background: [Branch, Role]
Current Focus: Applying systematic thinking to entrepreneurial productivity

## Key Positioning Points

2. **Week 2**: If no response, share specific "grit story" from military service
3. **Week 3**: Mention Dunedain portfolio connection (military AI parallel)
4. **Month 1**: Share BuildOS systematic execution case study

### Preparation Before Sending

- [ ] Prepare specific military resilience/grit story
- [ ] Document Curri integration metrics and systematic approach
- [ ] Research Outlander portfolio for pattern matching
