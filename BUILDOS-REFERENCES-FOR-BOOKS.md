book directory- /Users/djwayne/Desktop/book-pics

**Project:** BuildOS - AI-first project organization app
**Stage:** Finding product-market fit, company building

This document contains frameworks, concepts, and insights from the book collection relevant to BuildOS development.

---

## Priority 1: Product-Market Fit

### How to Create Innovation (Folder: 08-How-to-Create-Innovation)

**This is your most valuable resource for PMF.**

#### UNITE Innovation Approach (4 Stages)

1. **Stage 1: Setup** - Define business direction, search field, opportunity space
2. **Stage 2: Problem/Solution Fit** (12 weeks) - JTBD identification, design concepts
3. **Stage 3: Solution/Market Fit** - MVP, real-life validation, iterations
4. **Stage 4: Build & Scale** (15-36 months) - Operating model, growth hacking

#### Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) Framework

The #1 problem in innovation: analyzing from the business perspective, not the customer's.

**Key insight:** People don't buy products, they "hire" them to do jobs.

- Looking good (not weight management)
- Entertainment (not TV)
- Leisure (not a sailboat)

**For BuildOS:** What job are users hiring an AI project organization app to do? Is it:

- Reducing cognitive load?
- Never forgetting context?
- Shipping faster?
- Looking competent to stakeholders?

#### Pirate Metrics Funnel (AAARRR)

| Metric          | Question                     | BuildOS Application                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Awareness**   | How many people do we reach? | Content, SEO, dev communities                    |
| **Acquisition** | How do we define acquired?   | Signed up, connected first project               |
| **Activation**  | What's the WOW moment?       | First AI-generated insight? First saved context? |
| **Revenue**     | How many purchase?           | Conversion to paid                               |
| **Retention**   | How many come back?          | DAU/WAU, session frequency                       |
| **Referral**    | How many recommend?          | NPS, word of mouth                               |

#### Problem/Solution Fit Scorecard

Rate 0-10 on each:

- Importance of job to customer
- Current customer satisfaction (lower = opportunity)
- Does your solution solve the job?
- Preference over substitutes
- Buyer readiness
- User experience
- Addressable market size

**Final decision: Kill, Pivot, or MVP?**

#### Solution/Market Fit - The Big 8

1. Traction - Has the product achieved traction?
2. Market-timing - Is this the right time?
3. Team/execution - Right team in place?
4. Quality of the idea - Innovative enough for unfair advantage?
5. Business model - Efficient and defendable?
6. Funding - Resources to succeed?
7. Leveraging strengths - Using core capabilities?
8. Scale - Can we scale? Ready to scale?

---

### Traction (Folder: 52-Traction)

**EOS - Entrepreneurial Operating System**

#### The Vision Component

Core questions to answer:

- What are your core values? (3-7 values that define culture)
- What is your core focus? (Purpose + Niche)
- What is your 10-year target?
- What is your marketing strategy?
- What is your 3-year picture?
- What is your 1-year plan?
- What are your quarterly rocks?

**For BuildOS:** Define these clearly. What's the 10-year vision for AI-first project management?

---

### Good Strategy Bad Strategy (Folder: 01-Good-Strategy-Bad-Strategy)

#### The Kernel of Good Strategy

1. **Diagnosis** - What's the challenge? (Not a goal, an obstacle)
2. **Guiding Policy** - The approach to dealing with the challenge
3. **Coherent Actions** - Coordinated steps that implement the policy

**Bad strategy signs:**

- Fluff (buzzwords masking lack of thought)
- Failure to face the challenge
- Mistaking goals for strategy
- Bad strategic objectives

**For BuildOS:** What's the actual hard problem you're solving? Be specific.

---

## Priority 2: Team & Operations

### Team Topologies (Folder: 51-Team-Topologies)

#### Four Fundamental Team Types

1. **Stream-aligned team** - Aligned to a flow of work (main value delivery)
2. **Enabling team** - Helps stream-aligned teams with capabilities
3. **Complicated subsystem team** - Handles complex components
4. **Platform team** - Provides internal services

#### Conway's Law

"Organizations design systems that mirror their communication structure."

**For BuildOS:** Your team structure will shape your product architecture. Design intentionally.

### First, Break All the Rules (Folder: 41-First-Break-All-the-Rules)

#### The Q12 - Measuring Team Engagement

1. Do I know what's expected of me?
2. Do I have the materials and equipment to do my work?
3. Do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?
4. In the last 7 days, have I received recognition?
5. Does my supervisor care about me as a person?
6. Is there someone who encourages my development?
7. Do my opinions count?
8. Does the company mission make me feel important?
9. Are my coworkers committed to quality?
10. Do I have a best friend at work?
11. Has someone talked to me about my progress?
12. Have I had opportunities to learn and grow?

#### The Four Keys of Great Managers

1. Select for talent (not just experience)
2. Define the right outcomes (not steps)
3. Focus on strengths (not weaknesses)
4. Find the right fit (not the next rung)

### The Effective Executive (Folder: 47-The-Effective-Executive)

**Drucker's core insight:** Effectiveness can be learned.

Key practices:

- Know where your time goes
- Focus on contribution, not effort
- Build on strengths
- Concentrate on the few major areas
- Make effective decisions

---

## Priority 3: Thinking & Decision Making

### Range (Folder: 34-Range)

**Core thesis:** Generalists often outperform specialists, especially in "wicked" learning environments.

**For BuildOS:** Don't over-specialize too early. Keep learning breadth. The AI space is a wicked environment—rules are unclear, feedback is delayed.

---

### Thinking in Bets (Folder: 48-Thinking-in-Bets)

**Core concept:** Think in probabilities, not certainties.

- Resulting: Judging decisions by outcomes rather than process
- Learn to say "I'm not sure" - express confidence as percentages
- Outcome = Decision Quality + Luck

**For BuildOS:** When a feature fails, was it a bad decision or bad luck? Separate the two.

---

### Rationality (Folder: 36-Rationality)

**Useful concepts:**

- Bayesian reasoning - Update beliefs based on evidence
- Motivated reasoning - We believe what we want to believe
- Myside bias - We're better at critiquing others' arguments

**For BuildOS:** Be aware of confirmation bias when interpreting user feedback.

---

## Priority 4: AI-Specific

### AI in Sales (Folder: 18-AI-in-Sales)

Covers AI applications in:

- Task prioritization
- Prospecting
- Pre-call planning
- Deal predictions
- Risk alerts
- Account expansion
- Competitor analysis

**For BuildOS:** These are adjacent problem spaces. What can you learn from AI in sales about AI in project management?
