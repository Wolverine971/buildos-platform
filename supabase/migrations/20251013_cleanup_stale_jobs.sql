-- Migration: Cleanup stale and failed jobs
-- Created: 2025-10-13
-- Purpose: Remove old failed/pending job records to reduce database bloat
--
-- What this migration does:
-- 1. Deletes failed queue_jobs older than 30 days
-- 2. Deletes failed/pending daily_briefs older than 30 days
-- 3. Deletes stuck 'processing' daily_briefs older than 7 days
-- 4. Deletes failed/pending project_daily_briefs older than 30 days
--
-- Safety: Only removes failed/pending/stuck records, keeps all completed/successful data
