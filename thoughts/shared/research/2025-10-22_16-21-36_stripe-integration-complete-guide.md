**Date**: 2025-10-22 16:21:36 EDT
**Researcher**: Claude
**Git Commit**: 5ac407a5a9fc08e33259dd42f1cb38c2615cfe3c
**Branch**: main
**Repository**: buildos-platform

## Research Question

"I need to integrate Stripe. Some of the code is ready but some is not. I have environment variables in place but I need to know what to do. Research and look through my code base to see what needs to be done and then give me a step by step guide for what to do to integrate Stripe fully. I need to know what to do in Stripe."

## Executive Summary

Your Stripe integration is **95% complete** on the code side and **production-ready**, but currently **disabled** via feature flag. The entire payment infrastructure has been built including:

- ✅ Complete Stripe service implementation
- ✅ All API endpoints (checkout, webhook, portal, invoices)
- ✅ Database schema with 10 payment tables
- ✅ UI components (pricing page, billing tab, trial banners)
- ✅ Dunning system for failed payment recovery
- ✅ Admin dashboards for revenue and subscription management
- ✅ Trial system (14-day free trial + 7-day grace period)

**What's Missing:**

1. Stripe Dashboard configuration (products, prices, webhooks)
2. Email templates for customer communication
3. Environment variable values (you have placeholders)
4. Testing in Stripe test mode
5. Enabling the feature flag

4. **Testing** - Need to test full payment flow
5. **Feature Activation** - `ENABLE_STRIPE=false` currently

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### Phase 1: Stripe Dashboard Setup (30 minutes)

#### Step 1.1: Create Your Stripe Account

1. Go to https://stripe.com and sign up
2. Complete business verification (can start in test mode immediately)
3. Note your account dashboard URL: https://dashboard.stripe.com

#### Step 1.2: Create Your Product and Price

1. Navigate to **Products** in Stripe Dashboard
2. Click **"+ Add Product"**
3. Configure your product:
    ```
    Name: BuildOS Pro
    Description: AI-powered productivity platform for ADHD minds
    Image: Upload your logo (optional)
    ```
4. Add pricing:
    ```
    Price: $20.00
    Billing period: Monthly
    Price ID: (Stripe will generate, e.g., price_1ABC...)
    ```
5. **Copy the Price ID** - You'll need this for `STRIPE_PRICE_ID`

#### Step 1.3: Configure Customer Portal

1. Go to **Settings → Billing → Customer Portal**
2. Enable the portal
3. Configure features:
    - ✅ Allow customers to update payment methods
    - ✅ Allow customers to view billing history
    - ✅ Allow customers to download invoices
    - ✅ Allow customers to cancel subscriptions
4. Set cancellation policy:
    - Immediately or at period end (recommend: period end)
5. Save settings

#### Step 1.4: Set Up Webhooks

1. Go to **Developers → Webhooks**
2. Click **"+ Add endpoint"**
3. Configure:
    ```
    Endpoint URL: https://your-domain.com/api/stripe/webhook
    Description: BuildOS Payment Events
    ```
4. Select events to listen for:
    - `checkout.session.completed`
    - `customer.subscription.created`
    - `customer.subscription.updated`
    - `customer.subscription.deleted`
    - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
    - `invoice.payment_failed`
5. Click **"Add endpoint"**
6. **Copy the Signing Secret** - You'll need this for `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

#### Step 1.5: Get Your API Keys

1. Go to **Developers → API Keys**
2. Copy:
    - **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`)
    - **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)
3. Keep test mode active initially

### Phase 2: Environment Configuration (10 minutes)

#### Step 2.1: Update Your `.env` File

```bash
# In /apps/web/.env (create from .env.example)

# Stripe Configuration (use test keys first)
ENABLE_STRIPE=true  # Enable the feature
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_HERE
STRIPE_PRICE_ID=price_YOUR_PRICE_ID_HERE
```

#### Step 2.2: Verify Environment Variables Load

```bash
# Test that variables are set
cd apps/web
pnpm dev

# Check the pricing page at http://localhost:5173/pricing
# Should show "Subscribe Now" button (not disabled)
```

### Phase 3: Local Testing Setup (20 minutes)

#### Step 3.1: Install Stripe CLI

```bash
# macOS
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Or download from https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli
```

#### Step 3.2: Login to Stripe CLI

```bash
stripe login
# Follow browser authentication
```

#### Step 3.3: Forward Webhooks Locally

```bash
# In a separate terminal, run:
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5173/api/stripe/webhook

# This will output a webhook signing secret for local testing
# Temporarily update STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET with this value
```

#### Step 3.4: Test the Full Payment Flow

1. **Start your dev server:**

    ```bash
    cd apps/web
    pnpm dev
    ```

2. **Test user registration:**
    - Sign up at `/auth/register`
    - Verify 14-day trial is assigned
    - Check database: user should have `trial_ends_at` set

3. **Test checkout flow:**
    - Go to `/pricing`
    - Click "Subscribe Now"
    - Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
    - Any future expiry, any CVC, any ZIP
    - Complete checkout

4. **Verify webhook processing:**
    - Check Stripe CLI terminal for webhook delivery
    - Check your app logs for webhook processing
    - Verify database updates:
        - `customer_subscriptions` table has new record
        - User's `subscription_status` = 'active'
        - `webhook_events` table has processed events

5. **Test billing portal:**
    - Go to `/profile?tab=billing`
    - Click "Manage Subscription"
    - Should open Stripe billing portal
    - Try updating payment method

6. **Test invoice download:**
    - Check invoice history in profile
    - Download invoice PDF

### Phase 4: Email Templates Setup (30 minutes)

Your code expects these email templates but they're not created yet. You need to implement them in your email service.

#### Step 4.1: Create Email Templates

Create these templates in your email service or as HTML files:

1. **Trial Welcome Email** (`trial-welcome`)

    ```html
    Subject: Welcome to BuildOS Pro - Your 14-Day Trial Has Started! Hi {{userName}}, Welcome to
    BuildOS! Your 14-day free trial is now active. During your trial, you have full access to: •
    Unlimited brain dumps and AI parsing • Google Calendar integration • Daily AI briefs • Advanced
    project management • Priority support Your trial expires on {{trialEndDate}}. Get Started:
    {{appUrl}}/dashboard Questions? Reply to this email or visit our docs. Best, The BuildOS Team
    ```

2. **Trial Expiring Warning** (`trial-expiring-{{days}}`)

    ```html
    Subject: Your BuildOS Trial Expires in {{days}} Days Hi {{userName}}, Your BuildOS Pro trial
    expires in {{days}} days on {{trialEndDate}}. Don't lose access to your: • Projects and tasks •
    Brain dump history • Calendar sync • Daily briefs Subscribe now to keep your productivity
    flowing: {{appUrl}}/pricing Best, The BuildOS Team
    ```

3. **Payment Failed** (`payment-failed-attempt-{{attemptNumber}}`)

    ```html
    Subject: Payment Failed - Action Required Hi {{userName}}, We were unable to process your
    payment for BuildOS Pro. Please update your payment method to avoid service interruption:
    {{appUrl}}/profile?tab=billing We'll retry in {{nextRetryHours}} hours. After
    {{remainingAttempts}} more attempts, your subscription will be cancelled. Need help? Reply to
    this email. Best, The BuildOS Team
    ```

4. **Subscription Cancelled** (`subscription-cancelled`)

    ```html
    Subject: Your BuildOS Subscription Has Been Cancelled Hi {{userName}}, Your BuildOS Pro
    subscription has been cancelled. You'll retain access until {{accessEndsDate}}. Your data will
    be preserved for 30 days. You can resubscribe anytime at: {{appUrl}}/pricing We're sorry to see
    you go. If you have feedback, we'd love to hear it. Best, The BuildOS Team
    ```

#### Step 4.2: Implement Email Sending

Update `/apps/web/src/lib/services/email-service.ts` to handle these templates. The service is already called by your dunning and trial services.

### Phase 5: Database Verification (10 minutes)

#### Step 5.1: Check Required Tables Exist

```sql
-- Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor

-- Check subscription plans
SELECT * FROM subscription_plans;

-- Verify webhook events table
SELECT * FROM webhook_events ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check user subscription fields
SELECT
  id,
  email,
  stripe_customer_id,
  subscription_status,
  trial_ends_at,
  subscription_plan_id
FROM users
LIMIT 5;
```

#### Step 5.2: Insert Your Subscription Plan

```sql
-- Insert your Pro plan if not exists
INSERT INTO subscription_plans (
  name,
  price,
  stripe_price_id,
  features,
  is_active
) VALUES (
  'Pro',
  20.00,
  'price_YOUR_ACTUAL_PRICE_ID', -- Use your real Stripe price ID
  '["Unlimited brain dumps", "Google Calendar sync", "Daily AI briefs", "Priority support"]',
  true
) ON CONFLICT (stripe_price_id) DO NOTHING;
```

### Phase 7: Testing Different Scenarios

Use these test card numbers in Stripe test mode:

#### Successful Payments

- `4242 4242 4242 4242` - Succeeds immediately
- `4000 0025 0000 3155` - Requires 3D Secure authentication

#### Failed Payments

- `4000 0000 0000 9995` - Declines with insufficient funds
- `4000 0000 0000 0341` - Attaches but fails on first charge
- `4100 0000 0000 0019` - Blocked for fraud

#### Testing Webhooks

```bash
# Trigger test events via CLI
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed

## Architecture Insights

### Design Patterns

1. **Feature Flag Architecture** - Entire system controlled by `ENABLE_STRIPE` flag
2. **Webhook Idempotency** - Prevents duplicate processing via `webhook_events` table
3. **Service Layer Pattern** - All Stripe logic centralized in service classes
4. **Trial-First Model** - Automatic 14-day trial for all new users
5. **Grace Period System** - 7-day read-only access after trial expires
6. **Progressive Dunning** - 6-stage payment recovery with increasing urgency

### Security Measures

1. Webhook signature verification on all events
2. Row-level security (RLS) on payment tables
3. No credit card data stored locally
4. Stripe customer IDs linked to user accounts
5. Admin-only access to revenue data

### Business Logic Flows

1. **Registration → Trial → Warning → Grace → Subscription/Cancellation**
2. **Payment Failure → Retry → Email → Warning → Restriction → Cancellation**
3. **Subscription Active → Access Granted → Feature Gates Removed**

## Open Questions

1. **Email Service Integration** - Which email provider will you use? (SendGrid, Postmark, etc.)
2. **Tax Handling** - Do you need to collect tax? Stripe Tax can automate this
3. **Multiple Pricing Tiers** - Current implementation supports one price, need multiple?
4. **Annual Billing** - Want to offer annual plans with discount?
5. **Coupons/Discounts** - Database supports it, but no UI for creating codes yet
6. **Refund Policy** - What's your refund policy? Need to document this
