## 🧭 Scheduling Philosophy: “Guided Flexibility”

The **TimeBlocks feature** should embody *guided flexibility* — a balance between automation and user agency.

### 1. **Humans Set Priorities, AI Manages Time**

Instead of rigidly scheduling every task, BuildOS identifies **free time gaps** in a user’s calendar, then intelligently suggests *what to do* in those spaces.

* The user doesn’t have to plan every hour — they just declare *what’s important right now*.
* The system becomes a “decision assistant” that *allocates attention*, not just time.

### 2. **Flow-Based Productivity, Not Task Lists**

Traditional productivity tools treat time like a container for to-dos.
TimeBlocks treat time as *a flow to be optimized for meaning and energy*.

* Gaps aren’t “empty hours” — they’re opportunities to align energy, focus, and goals.
* Each block becomes a *commitment zone*: a focused session optimized for one cognitive mode (deep work, light admin, creative, social).

### 3. **Context-Aware AI Scheduling**

BuildOS learns from context:

* Calendar events → existing commitments
* Project metadata → priority, energy type, required duration
* User mood or focus signals (optional future input)

Then it recommends *how to fill the gaps* based on both productivity theory and the user’s intent:

* “You have 5 free hours Saturday — would you rather make progress on your book or your fitness project?”
* “You have 2 hours of open time tomorrow morning; this is your best focus window for deep work.”

## ⚙️ Core Architecture Sketch

Here’s how the system could be structured in layers:

### 1. **Calendar Layer (Input: Time Gaps)**

- Pull user’s events from Google Calendar / Apple Calendar.
- Sort each day into blocks of **occupied** vs **available** time.
- Identify free “gaps” between events that meet a minimum threshold (e.g., 30+ minutes).

  ```text
  9am–11am meeting → occupied
  11am–2pm gap → available
  2pm–3pm call → occupied
  3–5pm gap → available
  ```

### 2. **Context Layer (Input: Projects & Goals)**

Each project in BuildOS carries metadata:

- `priority_score` (based on urgency/impact)
- `energy_type` (creative, analytical, admin)
- `flexibility` (can this task move around?)
- `duration_estimate`

This allows the system to match _gaps_ with _appropriate project work_.

### 3. **Decision Layer (AI Matching Engine)**

The AI evaluates:

- The _value density_ of each project (priority ÷ estimated effort)
- The _fit_ with available time windows
- The _user’s preferences_ for spontaneity vs structure

It then outputs _proposed TimeBlocks_:

```json
{
  "date": "2025-10-07",
  "time_range": "11:00-13:00",
  "suggested_project": "Finish marketing site redesign",
  "rationale": "High impact project, fits deep-work time window"
}
```

### 4. **User Layer (Interface: Choice + Override)**

The UI presents these gaps visually:

- “You have 3 free blocks tomorrow”
- Each block can show _AI suggestion_ + _alternative options_
  e.g.

  > 🟩 11:00–13:00 → Deep Work (suggested: Website redesign)
  > 🟨 15:00–16:30 → Light work (suggested: Inbox clean-up)

Users can **accept**, **swap**, or **lock** a TimeBlock.

## 🧘‍♂️ Behavioral Design Philosophy

This feature isn’t about cramming tasks — it’s about _mindful structure_.
It should:

- Help users **make peace with unfinished tasks** by focusing on what matters most right now.
- Provide **psychological safety** — AI assists, but doesn’t dictate.
- Create a feeling of _momentum_ through small, meaningful completions.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **Energy tracking:** correlate productivity patterns with time of day to suggest optimal block placement.
- **Adaptive rescheduling:** if an event is canceled, BuildOS auto-suggests re-filling the time gap.
- **Project velocity estimation:** measure time spent on projects vs goals to inform future prioritization.
- **AI-generated daily briefs:** “Here’s how your day is shaping up — 3 TimeBlocks available, here’s what I recommend.”
