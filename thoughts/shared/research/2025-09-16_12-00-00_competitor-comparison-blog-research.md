## Research Question

Create comprehensive research and draft blog outlines for three competitor comparison posts: BuildOS vs Notion, BuildOS vs Monday.com, and BuildOS vs Obsidian. Focus on honest, unbiased comparisons that highlight where BuildOS excels and where competitors might be better suited for certain users.

## Summary

Based on comprehensive research of the BuildOS codebase and external competitor analysis, three distinct blog comparisons should be created targeting different use cases:

1. **BuildOS vs Notion**: Focus on simplicity vs. complexity for ADHD minds
