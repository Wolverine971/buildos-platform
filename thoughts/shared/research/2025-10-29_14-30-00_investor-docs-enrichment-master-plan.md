# Investor Documentation Enrichment Master Plan

**Date**: October 29, 2025, 2:30 PM PST
**Researcher**: Claude
**Git Commit**: d44e3dde44d5dba41dfeac4c0ff729cab1ff63c6
**Branch**: main
**Repository**: buildos-platform

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive plan for enriching 48 investor-related documents in `docs/marketing/investors/`. Based on extensive research of VC firms, individual investors, and market conditions for 2024-2025, this plan outlines specific enrichments, data updates, cross-linking strategies, and a phased execution approach.

### Documents Analyzed

- **7** Strategy/Overview docs (fundraising strategy, checklists, optimists/skeptics)
- **7** Individual investor profiles
- **22** VC firm profiles
- **9** Outreach templates/strategies
- **3** Warm introduction emails

**Total**: 48 documents requiring enrichment

---

## Research Findings Summary

### Research Completed

Five parallel research agents completed comprehensive investigations:

1. **VC Firm News (2024-2025)** - Top 6 firms researched (a16z, Sequoia, First Round, Point Nine, AIX, Character)
2. **Individual Investor Contact Info** - 6 investors (Mortensen, Blomfield, Singerman, Caruso, Raines, Hsia)
3. **VC Firm Contact Info** - 10 firms with submission processes and email formats
4. **Investor Recent Activity** - 5 investors with social media, podcasts, recent investments
5. **Additional VC Firm Research** - 9 more firms (Bessemer, Greylock, Lightspeed, etc.)

### Key Findings

#### Critical Updates Needed

1. **❌ No YAML Frontmatter** - Zero documents have structured metadata
2. **❌ Contact Information Gaps** - Missing emails, Twitter handles, LinkedIn URLs
3. **❌ Outdated Information** - Some docs reference outdated roles, old fund sizes
4. **❌ No 2024-2025 News** - Missing recent investments, fund announcements, partner changes
5. **❌ Minimal Cross-Linking** - Docs exist in silos without proper references
6. **❌ No Master Index** - Difficult to navigate 48 documents

#### Notable Outdated Info

- **VC-notes.md** - Says "Sept 17 2025" (likely typo for 2024)
- **Brian Singerman** - Left Founders Fund (Dec 2024), started GPx - needs update
- **Fund sizes** - Multiple firms raised new funds in 2024-2025
- **Contact emails** - Several investors changed companies/roles

---

## Enrichment Categories & Execution Plan

### Category 1: YAML Frontmatter (All 48 Docs)

**Purpose**: Add structured metadata for navigation, searchability, and organization.

**Standard Frontmatter Template**:

```yaml
---
title: "[Document Title]"
doc_type: "[profile|strategy|outreach|warm-intro|firm-profile]"
investor_name: "[Name if applicable]"
firm_name: "[Firm if applicable]"
priority: "[high|medium|low]"
last_updated: "2025-10-29"
status: "[active|archived|needs-update]"
tags: [investors, fundraising, relevant-tags]
related_docs:
  - path/to/related/doc1.md
  - path/to/related/doc2.md
contact_verified: "[yes|no|partial]"
---
```

**Execution Strategy**: Add frontmatter systematically by document type.
