# My vision

Have a flexible schema where buildos can handle the creation and evolution of any project and project type.

To do this I need an ontology for different types of projects.

This helps me preload different project type info that is familiar to the user and gives the user flexiblility to use buildOS to manage their project workflow.

## forward deployed PM

- what is your workflow, model it in buildos
    - find a writer
    - find a student
    - find a VC
    - build the workflow for them

## jobs to be done

- find a cracked marketer that is genz knows the platforms and edit videos, can be infront of the camera and can be behind the camera

## first class functionalities

- braindumping information- should be able to talk about a project and it gets created and updated frictionlessly
    - requires a prompting and ai agent orchestration flow to understand the user and the project's context and to dynamically make updates based on what the user says.

-

## what is important in buildos

- visualizations are improtant and need to be first class citzen

## parking lot of ideas

- graph visualization of what is going on and show the different relationships of things going on
- ai agent delegation
    - agent asks questions before proceeding to ensure output is close to what the user intended

## what the user gains from working with buildos

- frictionless project management
- fast clarity into what is the current state of the project
- flexible focus for what the user wants to work on and build

## future gains

- seemless ai agent and human interaction and collaboration

## Tag line

- buildos for the empire builders

## Sub tag line

- frictionlessly build the projects you dream of in an ai playground,
- delegate tasks to ai agents

- AI agent task delegation
    - ai agents ask questions before proceeding
