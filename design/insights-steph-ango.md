## The Power of Constraints

### Constraints Enable Creativity

Steph learned the power of constraints from his earliest design work - making Winamp skins in the early 2000s:

> "You had to work within a certain number of pixels just to do a volume slider. You had so little that you could do, but yet that's where all the creativity came from. I would look at some people who I thought were amazing Winamp skin artists back then and I was like, 'How did they figure out how to put this entire little animation in a movement of 12 pixels?'"

**Key insight:** Constraints don't limit creativity - they focus it. The tighter the constraint, the more inventive the solution must be.

### Self-Imposed Constraints as Style

Modern digital space has been a continuous removal of constraints. Steph deliberately re-imposes them:

> "You want things, in general, to be recognizably you and to become easier and easier for you to do. Writing is difficult if you have no constraints. If you know that, okay, I'm going to try to fit in this idea in 500 words, then you know the kinds of things that you're probably not going to write about."

**The Pattern:**

- Choose constraints that match your values
- Let constraints become your signature style
- Use constraints to force focus and clarity

### Constraint-Driven Decision Making

At Obsidian, constraints eliminate endless decision-making:

> "We have this decision framework that helps everyone on the team just continue rowing in the same direction. I don't have to do anything. Everyone's just working on it together. It has removed a whole bunch of decisions that we didn't have to make because everyone knows what the Obsidian way of doing the thing is."

**BuildOS Application:**

- Define core constraints early (what you will NOT do)
- Let constraints become a decision-making framework
- Use constraints to free up mental energy for creative work

## File Over App Philosophy

### Data Ownership as a Political Statement

> "File over app is really a political statement. I think that this is societally important, civilizationally important. It's a rejection of how big tech and a lot of companies are built in the software ecosystem these days."

**Core Principle:** Users should own their data in formats that outlive any app. Files are durable; apps are temporary.

### Durability Over Decades

The time horizon matters - think in centuries, not product cycles:

> "I try to have the longest possible time horizon in both directions. We've been talking about it in the scheme of thousands of years, both looking back and forward... How have people been doing this particular thing for a long time, and what is likely to last for a long time?"

**Practical Application:**

- Plain text and markdown survive app changes
- Open formats enable migration and longevity
- User data should be portable and readable without your app

### Movement Over Product

File Over App has become bigger than Obsidian:

> "There are about 10 different startups that have started based on 'File over App.' They're like, 'We're doing File over App for accounting. We're doing File over App for this or that.'... If we thought of File over App as a proprietary idea that only we should be the ones focusing on, it would be less powerful."

**BuildOS Application:**

- Brain dump data should be in portable, open formats
- Users must be able to export and own their thoughts
- Consider how your data format serves users for decades

## Toolmaking Principles

### What is a Tool?

> "My favorite definition of a tool is it's something that converts what you can do into what you want to do. A hammer is a perfect example. You have what you want to do, which is put a nail into a wall, and what you have is a hand. You have to convert what your arms can do into a point of hard steel."

**Key insight:** Tools bridge the gap between human capability and human desire.

### Tools Conform to Humans

> "The best tools conform to us as much as possible and allow us to do something that we want to do... We have eyes. We can speak. These are the things that we have at our disposal. This informs the shape a tool designed for human use should have."

**Design Implication:** Start with human constraints (fingers, eyes, attention), then design the tool to fit those constraints.

### The Edge of Toolmaking

> "The edge of tool-making is always, what are some new things that we want to do that we never thought of doing before? What are some new capabilities in the way that we can make tools?"

**For BuildOS:**

- What does AI enable that humans couldn't do before?
- How does AI extend human capability in thought organization?
- What new desires emerge when brain-to-task conversion is instant?

## Writing & Thinking

### Writing for Your Younger Self

Steph's essays are concise because of a specific constraint:

> "I'm writing to a younger version of myself. I'm imagining that the only thing I can pass on to this younger version of myself is X number of words. Here's the most concise way I can communicate this across time to this younger version of myself."

**Result:** Essays with no footnotes, no references - just distilled opinion.

### The Stadium of Selves

> "If you think of yourself as, let's say you live 80 years, each new day is one person, it would fill up a stadium... Your current self, today's self, is on stage. You're in the middle of the stadium and all of your past and future selves are sitting in the audience."

**Application for BuildOS:**

- Users are capturing thoughts for future selves
- The tool should help past self communicate with future self
- Brain dumps are letters across time

### Editing Over Time

> "I will edit old pieces all the time. I don't put 'last edited' or 'versions' or anything like that. I just don't care about the continuity of it. I'm trying to make each one really good."

**Key insight:** The artifact matters more than the history. Polish over time.

### What Can We Remove?

> "The idea of what can we remove is just a question that is hopefully useful for a group or for yourself when you're working on something. Remind yourself to ask that question: What can I remove? What can we remove? What's not contributing to the thing?"

**Quote from T.S. Eliot:**

> "Only those who are willing to go too far can possibly find out how far one can go."

**Practical Application:**

- Regularly ask: what can be removed from this feature?
- Removal is invisible work that creates pristine experiences
- The beach metaphor: users enjoy a clean beach without knowing someone cleaned it

---

## Design Philosophy

### Efficiency Creates Beauty

> "The efficiency, in a way, is what creates beauty. I love looking at machinery because machinery is not trying to be beautiful necessarily, but it becomes beautiful just by the form following the function."

**Parallel to nature:**

> "It takes nature millions of years to get rid of something like a tailbone or an appendix. Nature has this way through evolution of shedding unnecessary things and being evolutionarily fit to its environment. So, what is necessary for a product to be fit to its environment?"

### Understandability as the Goal

> "The things that make a system feel appealing to use, ergonomic, intuitive, understandable, beautiful, they tend to find a way to distill what this thing is for into something that is easy to understand."

**Design Process:**

1. Search for how to make something understandable
2. Identify what's extraneous
3. Remove until the essence remains

### The Biological Design Lens

Steph's background in biology shaped his design thinking:

> "I have the choice to either study what nature has created and surrounds us with, or study what humans have created. The human path seemed more appealing because I could actually contribute something, as opposed to just studying something that was already made."

**Key insight:** Both nature and design are about fitness to environment. The weak die; only the fit continue.

## Building for Yourself

### The Core Motivation

> "The reason I'm making it is so that I can use it, not the other way around. And if I wasn't using it, then Obsidian, the tool, wouldn't be as good as it is."

**Steph is still one of Obsidian's top users:**

> "I'm still probably one of the top Obsidian users. I use Obsidian all the time, and I love using it. So, if I'm not working on it, I'm using it actively at least an hour a day."

### Make Something You Would Enjoy

> "People are also in the same situation that I am... This is just a trope at this point, but it's like, yeah, make something that you would enjoy. You know yourself well, and you're unique, but a lot of people have the same problem that you have."

**BuildOS Application:**

- Build the tool you desperately need
- Your unique frustrations are shared by many
- Dog-food relentlessly

### The Problem of Not Using Your Product

From Steph's previous startup (Lumi):

> "The thing that we were making, we were not using ourselves. And because we couldn't, we were busy building the software... I think, going back to the earlier topic of building something for yourself, if you really care about that, you have to make sure that it remains true even as the thing grows."

---

## The Plugin/Extension Model

### Why Plugins Work

> "What Erica came up with around the plugin architecture is genius because it allows the core of the app to stay relatively simple. We have millions of users. Every user has a different set of plugins. The multiplication of that is just, there's more different configurations of Obsidian in the world than atoms in the universe."

**Benefits:**

- Core stays simple
- Community builds edge cases
- Team stays small
- Infinite configurations without infinite complexity

### Links as the Foundation

> "I think the most important thing about Obsidian is just being able to click links and connect things with links. It's that simple. All of the extra stuff, everything else is on top of that foundation of just being able to link an idea to another idea."

**Key insight:** Find your irreducible primitive. For Obsidian it's links. What is it for BuildOS?

### Community as Force Multiplier

> "We rely a lot on the community to build all those different other extensions on top of the tool."

**This enables:**

- Small team (7 people)
- Massive feature surface
- User investment in the ecosystem

---

## Small Teams, Big Impact

### The Ocean's Eleven Model

> "I just like the 'Ocean's Eleven' model the best. It's just the most fun to have a very small team where you just...I love making stuff myself. I don't really enjoy being a manager."

**Obsidian's constraints:**

- 7 people full-time
- Internal limit of 10-12 people
- 100% user-supported (no investors)
- No hiring to solve problems

### Hiring is Off the Table

> "If we have this problem, hiring is off the table. We basically don't hire... If the problem comes up, we have to either figure out how to solve it ourselves, or we just decide it's not a problem we want to solve at all."

**Result:** Focus on fewer things, but do them exceptionally well.

### The Manifesto as Leverage

Writing the Obsidian manifesto created enormous leverage:

> "I feel total confidence that I could disappear for six months and the team would do almost exactly the same thing as if I'm around. That's a crazy feeling... the manifesto and everyone who's working on Obsidian is really passionate about those values."

**Benefits:**

- No meetings needed
- Decisions are pre-made by principles
- Everyone rows in the same direction
- Ideas multiply through others adopting the philosophy

---

## Investment & Compounding

### Long Time Horizons

> "Most people have a really short time horizon, and I try to have the longest possible time horizon in both directions... there's almost never a case where thinking about the impacts of that decision for the next 10 or 30 years really harms things that much."

### The 5-Year Rule for Recommendations

> "My rule for anything that I'll share is: I'm still using it five years later... It takes five years for one new post to be added to that. It's a filtration system."

### Seeds and Maturity

> "A lot of the process is just planting seeds and waiting for those things to reach a certain maturity where I can look back at them a year from now, five years from now, and I'm like, 'I still agree with myself. Therefore, I should post this.'"

**Steph's blog history:**

- Private blog for 10 years before publishing
- Used social media to test ideas and get friction
- Published only when ideas proved durable

### Nibble and Your Appetite Will Grow

> "L'appetit vient en mangeant" - Appetite comes when you eat.

> "If you see something that you're curious about, just go nibble at it and see if it's enjoyable to you. If it is, your appetite will grow."

**Application:** Start small. Lower the activation energy. One pushup leads to many.

---

## Agency & Learning

### The Parasite Problem

Steph describes how systems extract value from uninformed people:

> "If you're not educating yourself about it, you're allowing these predatory systems to live on top of you and extract your money, your time, your resources. There are entire industries that are just really good at doing that."

### Compounding Agency

> "Confidence is the memory of success."

**The Pattern:**

- Learn basic how things work
- Make informed decisions
- Gain confidence
- Take on more complex challenges
- Agency compounds

### Curiosity as the Driver

> "What's the point of being alive? The world is so complex, and that complexity is so beautiful... When I'm dead, I probably won't have time to think about electricians. This is the time to think about electricians."

**BuildOS Application:**

- Help users build agency through understanding
- Don't just do things for users - help them understand
- Capture and build on natural curiosity

---

## On AI & The Future

### AI as New Substrate for Tools

> "Right now, AI and LLMs are so fascinating because it's a new substrate for us to create tools that are really interesting. Humans are not very good at reading 7 million books in every language... But we have desires, like we want to make a new piece of software... Every bug that's ever been reported to Stack Overflow is in an LLM."

### Caloric vs Electric Energy

> "With the Industrial Revolution, we figured out how to take what muscles can do and turn them into machines. And now we're doing the same with intelligence. We're taking things that are very tedious to do with our mind and allowing a computer to do it."

**Result:** "Electric energy gives us the freedom to choose how we use caloric energy because caloric energy is precious."

### Earth Becoming Sentient

> "We are cells building this body and maintaining it... The Earth's mind is emerging... humans are inside the super intelligence. We are inside the Earth-sized machine."

**Why Steph is optimistic about AI:**

> "Why would this thing want to destroy the thing that is taking care of it? We're literally inside of this thing, maintaining it, taking care of it, connecting the wires together that make it possible for this thing to even have thoughts to begin with."

### Tools Unchanged Despite AI

> "People were making movies a hundred years ago. It was a little different. [But] will we just be typing with our fingers into a thing 50 years from now?"

**Key insight:** Core human needs remain constant. AI changes capability, not desire.

## Key Quotes

### On Constraints

> "Constraints just naturally occur from the medium... That's where all the creativity came from."

> "The lack of constraint, in certain cases, led us down decisions that were not as good as if we would have those constraints."

### On Tools

> "A tool is something that converts what you can do into what you want to do."

> "The best tools conform to us as much as possible and allow us to do something that we want to do."

### On Design

> "The efficiency, in a way, is what creates beauty."

> "What is necessary for a product to be fit to its environment? It has to be efficient at what it does."

### On Building

> "The reason I'm making it is so that I can use it, not the other way around."

> "If I wasn't using it, then Obsidian, the tool, wouldn't be as good as it is."

### On Removal

> "When you come to a pristine beach, you don't know who was there before picking up all the trash."

> "Most of the time, it's just too wordy, and I can simplify an idea. A lot of the words I remove are just connective words that are unnecessary."

### On Investment

> "If the only way that you make money or get value... is by selling your time or some version of that, you will never compound."

> "These types of things are really powerful because you can make it once and then a million people can download it at no extra cost."

### On Writing

> "I'm writing to a younger version of myself. I'm imagining that the only thing I can pass on to this younger version of myself is X number of words."

### On Selfishness

> "I think most people should be more selfish because this is the great thing about emergence. Societies, democracy, things work because people are making... selfish [decisions]."

### On Love and Safety Nets

> "Love... is having a safety net that allows you to do something that is more scary than you could have otherwise done."

### On the Inner Light

> "However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light." (Stanley Kubrick, quoted by Steph)

> "If you just let that curiosity grow and you go down that weird rabbit hole, maybe it'll lead to nothing, but maybe it will be a milestone."
