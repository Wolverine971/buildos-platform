## Overview

A deep philosophical conversation about the nature of design, "living tools" vs static designs, creating soulful software with AI, and Ryo's journey from pre-Figma design to becoming the first designer at Cursor. This episode explores the ideas and philosophies that underpin how Ryo approaches building software.

## Part 1: The Philosophy of "Final" Designs

### Rejecting Finality

**Ryo:** In my career as a professional product designer, the thing I hate the most is people want the design to be final. "Where's the final version of this mock? If you don't have it, I won't start building it."

That doesn't make sense because the first mock is never right.

### AI Output is the Beginning, Not the End

**Host:** Because AI is really good at composing parts, I'm actually thinking we need to build bricks. Really good bricks. Put your soul in it. You need to care about every detail. You need to not accept whatever purple gradient the AI gave you as the end.

**Ryo:** That is just the beginning.

**Host:** You always start with slop with AI and then you refine it.

**Ryo:** The beginning, not the end. You just poke at it with little prompts and then it'll get better.

## Part 2: Ryo's Background & Journey

### Pre-Figma Design Days

**Ryo:** I grew up in China, kind of self-taught. My mom was an artist, did Chinese ink painting. I was surrounded by that. Started with traditional art, then explored all the mediums I could - music, digital art, graphic design, motion graphics.

What I thought I wanted to do was visual storytelling. I went to film school, got really into directing. But I realized making films in China - so many things outside of your control. Permits, permissions, random people shutting you down.

With software, you have total control. Once you write code, it's yours. No one can change it. That's what I wanted.

### The Flash Era

**Ryo:** When I learned Flash, everything changed. It was the most primitive state of creative coding - you write code, things happen on screen.

From there, I went into game dev, built games, published stuff. Then moved to America, got a design degree while doing the same things - making websites, prototyping, coding, game stuff.

### Early Career: Capital One & Lyft

**Ryo:** My first job was at Capital One. I was there for a bit, then moved to Lyft.

At Lyft, I started not knowing anything. I got better because of a culture around feedback. Whenever I shipped something, I would screenshot it, write down my thoughts - almost like a little design blog. People would come back with feedback, I would improve.

### The Notion Years

**Ryo:** Notion was probably my longest tenure. I spent like four or five years there - longer than anywhere else.

I joined when there were maybe 15 or 20 people. I grew up with the company, learned a ton. The biggest thing was: what is building a product at scale? What does it mean to design systems?

At Notion, you don't think in features. You think in building blocks. The most foundational concept - pages can contain blocks, pages can contain pages, blocks can be databases. Everything is built on top of that.

When you think at that level, you can do so much more. But you also have to think about: does this make the overall system more complex? Does it fit? Every decision matters.

### Joining Cursor

**Ryo:** I left Notion around January and joined Cursor. Right now I'm the only full-time designer. We have another designer, Ricky, from Notion, who's helping part-time.

It's a really small team - maybe 20-something people, mostly engineers. There's no dedicated PM. Engineers own things end-to-end.

---

## Part 3: Design Philosophy

### Living Tools vs Static Design

**Ryo:** What I want to build is living tools. Not things that are finalized, shipped, and done. Things that grow with you, change as you use them.

Design artifacts are usually static - specs, mocks, prototypes. But the real product is alive. It changes, evolves, responds to users.

The gap between static design and living software is where a lot gets lost. I want to close that gap.

### The "Feel" is Everything

**Ryo:** You can't capture feel in mocks. You have to build it, touch it, interact with it.

When we built the stop and queue interaction at Cursor, it started as a code prototype. I showed it to people, they felt it, said "oh cool." That feedback loop - build, feel, iterate - is faster and more real than going through Figma.

### Why Figma Isn't Enough

**Ryo:** Figma is great for certain things - early exploration, defining visual patterns, layout iterations. It's fast for that.

But for anything with dynamic states, AI responses, interaction flows - you have to prototype in code. There's no other way to get the feel right.

## Part 4: Building with AI

### Start with Slop, Refine with Soul

**Ryo:** AI output is always slop at first. Generic, safe, boring. The purple gradients, the Shadcn defaults.

Your job is to take that slop and inject soul into it. Care about every detail. Don't accept the generic thing. Keep pushing, prompting, refining.

**Host:** Put your soul in the bricks.

**Ryo:** Exactly. Build really good bricks. The AI can compose them, but the bricks themselves need craft.

### Technical Foundation Matters

**Ryo:** I use Shadcn because AI knows it well - it's trained on tons of examples. Shadcn wraps Radix, which handles accessibility, keyboard navigation, all the hard stuff.

You build on that foundation, then customize. Override styles, create themes, add your own personality. But underneath, it's solid.

That's better than letting AI generate random components from scratch. Too error-prone.

### The Vibe Coding Evolution

**Ryo:** When I started, vibe coding required a lot of hand-holding. "Use Bun, use Shadcn, here's how my codebase is structured."

Now with better models and Cursor features, you can one-shot things. Get something close, then tweak. The barrier keeps getting lower.

## Part 5: How Cursor Works

### No Traditional Process

**Ryo:** At Cursor, there's no traditional design-to-dev handoff. No Jira tickets. No long specs.

It's more like: have an idea, prototype it, show it to people, iterate, ship. Everyone builds. The boundaries between designer and engineer are blurry.

### Everyone Codes

**Ryo:** I write code daily. Not backend stuff usually, but UI, interactions, prototypes. When I see something 50 pixels off, I can fix it myself instead of filing a ticket.

The engineers appreciate it. They see designers as part of the team, not a separate function that throws mocks over the wall.

### Small Teams, Big Impact

**Ryo:** We're maybe 20 people building one of the most influential tools in tech right now. That only works because everyone can contribute across boundaries.

When someone has an idea, they can just build it. Show it. If it's good, ship it. If not, throw it away. Fast loops.

## Part 6: The Future of Design

### Designers Will Revolt

**Ryo:** As designers learn to code - even with AI assistance - they'll realize how much of the old process was wasteful.

All that back-and-forth: "The engineer built it but it's 50 pixels off." Screenshots, redlines, specs, tickets. Loop again and again.

Versus: the designer opens Cursor, fixes it themselves, moves on. Or sends it to the background agent in Slack.

Once you experience that, you can't go back.

### What Stays the Same

**Ryo:** The core of design doesn't change:

- How you think about problems
- How you understand users
- How you structure systems
- How you name concepts
- How you simplify complexity

The execution changes. The thinking doesn't.

### Personalization is the Future

**Ryo:** The ideal interface is different for every person. Right now we design one interface for everyone and hope it's universal enough.

But with AI, interfaces can adapt. Reconfigure based on who you are, what you're doing, your preferences. Same underlying primitives, different surfaces.

---

## Part 7: Principles & Philosophy

### Simplicity vs Minimalism

**Ryo:** People confuse these. Minimalism is fewer things. Simplicity is clear concepts that compose.

Notion has three concepts: blocks, pages, databases. That's simple. But you can build infinitely complex things with them.

Cursor has: code, agents, models, tools. Simple concepts that compose into anything.

### Building for the Spectrum

**Ryo:** Every product has a spectrum of users. Manual control on one end, full automation on the other.

You need to serve both. Build mechanisms for people to move along the spectrum. Don't force everyone into one mode.

Some engineers want to type every character. Some want the AI to do everything. Both should feel at home.

### Don't Water It Down

**Ryo:** When you try to make something universal, you can water it down until it has no soul. It doesn't do the magic that made it special.

Better to have strong opinions, then let users customize. The default should be opinionated and soulful, not bland and generic.

---

## Part 8: The Creative Process

### Walking and Thinking

**Ryo:** I do a lot of walks around the office with my phone, typing ideas into Notion. Just bullet lists, conceptual stuff.

Walking helps me think. The ideas are rough, but they capture something. Later I can refine them.

### Different Tools for Different Problems

| Problem                | Tool                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Conceptual thinking    | Walking + Notion      |
| Visual exploration     | Figma                 |
| Interactions & feel    | Cursor prototypes     |
| Architecture & systems | Thinking + discussion |

### Pure Vibes

**Ryo:** Real OS - my personal project - was built with pure vibes. No plan, no spec. Just curiosity.

"What if I added a window?" "What if I made another app?" "What if the chat could write into the text editor?"

Each question led to the next. Over months, it became 130k lines of code. Just me and the agent, following curiosity.

## Part 9: Advice for Designers

### Getting Started with Code

1. **Download Cursor** - Just start
2. **Start simple** - Don't try to replicate your Figma workflow
3. **Explore with the agent** - Ask questions, make mistakes, learn
4. **Don't be afraid of errors** - Copy-paste them and ask the agent to fix

### What to Learn

Focus on:

- Component structure
- How data flows (props, state)
- Why things break
- How to read error messages

Don't focus on:

- Exact syntax
- Backend complexity
- Computer science fundamentals (yet)

### Build Personal Projects

If your company won't let you touch production code, build your own stuff. A personal OS. A weird tool. A game.

The skills transfer. And when you've shipped something yourself, you understand the full picture.

## Part 10: Key Quotes

### On Final Designs

> "Where's the final version of this mock? If you don't have it, I won't start building it." That doesn't make sense because the first mock is never right.

### On AI Output

> You always start with slop with AI and then you refine it. AI output is the beginning, not the end.

### On Building Blocks

> We need to build bricks. Really good bricks. Put your soul in it. You need to care about every detail.

### On the Future

> The ideal interface is different for every single person. Interfaces will become way more dynamic.

### On Simplicity

> Simplicity is not minimalism. At the core are really simple concepts. But they combine and multiply into emergent complexity.

### On Roles

> The boundaries between designer and engineer are blurry. We're just builders with ideas, wanting to build the best thing together.

### On Process

> There's a little ambiguous direction we want to go to, and there's the present state. All you want is for the steps to kind of align to that place. That's it.

## Closing Thoughts

The throughline of this conversation: design is not about artifacts, it's about building things that work. The tools are changing - AI, code-first prototyping, blurred roles - but the fundamentals remain. Understand systems. Think clearly. Put soul into the details. Ship fast. Learn faster.

As Ryo puts it: the first mock is never right. So stop trying to make it final. Start building, start feeling, start iterating. That's how good things get made.
