## LinkedIn-Specific Tips

### Algorithm Considerations

- **First hour is critical** - Early comments get more visibility
- **Comments > Reactions** - Substantive engagement matters more
- **2-4 sentences minimum** - Short comments count less
- **No external links** - Links in comments hurt visibility
- **Dwell time matters** - Thoughtful engagement is rewarded

### What Makes Good LinkedIn Comments

1. **Add perspective** - Not just "great post"
2. **Be specific** - Reference exact points from their post
3. **Ask questions** - Opens dialogue
4. **Share experience** - Brief relevant story
5. **Professional but human** - Authentic, not corporate
