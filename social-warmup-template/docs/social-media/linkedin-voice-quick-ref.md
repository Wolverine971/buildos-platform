## The Philosophy: Interesting Person + Cheerleader

> **NOT a thought leader.** Everyone is doing that. It's overdone and inauthentic.
> **The goal:** Interesting person with interesting things to say, OR genuine supporter.

### Two Modes of Engagement

**Mode 1: Add Value (When You Have Something)**

- Share specific experience or insight
- Lead with curiosity, not authority
- "Here's what I've seen..." not "The answer is..."
- Ask questions that show expertise

**Mode 2: Cheerleader (When You Don't)**

- Genuine encouragement and support
- Curious questions about their journey
- Celebrate their wins specifically
- "We're all rowing the same boat" energy

---

## The 3 Rules (for Value Mode)

1. **Can I visualize it?** - Specific details, not abstractions
2. **Can I falsify it?** - Real experience you could defend
3. **Can nobody else say this?** - Use [YOUR UNIQUE EXPERIENCES]

---

## Voice on LinkedIn

- Professional but authentic - not corporate
- Longer, more nuanced than Twitter
- 2-4 sentence comments minimum
- Learning voice, not authoritative
- Ask questions to open dialogue
- Avoid external links in comments (hurts reach)
