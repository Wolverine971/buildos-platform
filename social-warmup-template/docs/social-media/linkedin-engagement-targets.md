## LinkedIn Algorithm Notes

- **First hour engagement is CRITICAL** - algorithm weights early engagement heavily
- **Comments > Reactions** - substantive comments are more valuable than likes
- **2-4 sentence minimum** - short comments don't count as much
- **No external links in comments** - hurts visibility
- **Dwell time matters** - thoughtful engagement is rewarded

---

## Engagement Rules

1. **Speed matters** - Comment within 1 hour of post for max visibility
2. **Substance matters** - 2-4 sentences minimum
3. **No links** - Avoid external links in comments
4. **Be specific** - Reference exact parts of their post
5. **Ask questions** - Opens dialogue, shows genuine interest
6. **Don't oversell** - Product mention only when genuinely relevant

---

## Account Discovery Criteria

When scanning feed, flag accounts if they:

- Post about topics relevant to your niche
- Have 5K-100K followers (LinkedIn engagement sweet spot)
- Post consistently (multiple times per week)
- Have good comment engagement (not just reactions)
- Write authentically (not generic thought leader content)
- Are builders, founders, or practitioners

---

**Next Steps:**

1. Follow/connect with accounts from this list
2. Turn on notifications for Tier 1 accounts if possible
3. Run `/linkedin-warmup` daily for fresh opportunities
4. Track which comments get responses
