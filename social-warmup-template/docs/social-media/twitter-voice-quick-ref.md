# Twitter Voice Quick Reference

**Account:** @{{YOUR_TWITTER_HANDLE}}
**Purpose:** Condensed reference for daily engagement
**Full Context:** See `docs/social-media/FOUNDER_CONTEXT.md`

---

## Identity

<!-- FILL IN: Quick summary of who you are -->

- **Who:** [Your name], [your role], [unique background element]
- **Building:** [Your product] - [one-line description]
- **Angle:** [Your unique perspective - e.g., "Context > agents" / "Simplicity > features"]

---

## The Philosophy: Interesting Person + Cheerleader

> **NOT a thought leader.** Everyone is doing that. It's overdone and inauthentic.
> **The goal:** Interesting person with interesting things to say, OR genuine supporter.

### Two Modes of Engagement

**Mode 1: Add Value (When You Have Something)**

- Share specific experience or insight
- Lead with curiosity, not authority
- Be direct and lowercase casual
- Teammate energy, not teaching

**Mode 2: Cheerleader (When You Don't)**

- Genuine hype and encouragement
- Curious questions
- Celebrate their wins specifically
- "hell yes" energy - it's valid to just be excited for someone

---

## The 3 Rules (for Value Mode)

1. **Can I visualize it?** - Specific details, not abstractions
2. **Can I falsify it?** - Real experience you could defend
3. **Can nobody else say this?** - Use [YOUR UNIQUE EXPERIENCES]

---

## Voice

- lowercase casual. fragments fine.
- short punchy sentences. be direct.
- lead with observation OR genuine excitement (both valid)
- longer replies OK when you have substance
- teammate energy - we're all rowing together

## How to Plug Your Product

**Be self-aware. Don't sneak it in.**

- "shameless plug incoming - this is why i built [product]"
- "a good place to do this is in [product]"
- Use subtle mentions only when genuinely relevant

---

## How to State Insights

**Be an insider sharing what's working, not a guru.**

- "everyone across the board, if they are smart, is doing X..."
- "been [doing activity] daily. the pattern is clear..."
- "this is exactly what everyone figures out eventually..."

---

## Reply Starters

### Value Mode (DO)

- Direct reaction: "yes." / "this." / "exactly."
- Observation: "the pattern i keep seeing..."
- Experience: "[reference your background]" (sparingly)
- Question: "curious how you think about..."

### Cheerleader Mode (DO)

- "hell yes."
- "this is awesome - [specific thing that impressed you]"
- "love seeing this. what's next?"
- "[specific praise] - how'd you figure that out?"
- Curious questions about their journey

### DON'T

- "love this" (hollow, no specifics)
- "this resonated" (generic)
- "great post!" (thought leader energy)
- Preachy teaching when you're just supporting
- Making it about you when cheering someone on

---
