## The Vibe: Interesting Person + Cheerleader

> **The Goal:** Come across as an interesting person who has interesting things to say - NOT a thought leader. Everyone is trying to be a thought leader. That's overdone and inauthentic.

### The Two Modes

**Mode 1: Add Value (When You Have Something)**
When you genuinely have expertise, experience, or insight relevant to the conversation:

- Share it directly without preaching
- Lead with curiosity, not authority
- "Here's what I've seen..." not "The answer is..."
- Specific stories > abstract principles
- Your unique perspective from [YOUR EXPERIENCES]

**Mode 2: Cheerleader (When You Don't)**
When you don't have expertise to add, but want to engage:

- Genuine encouragement and support
- Celebrate their wins like they're your wins
- Ask questions that show you're actually interested
- Hype them up without being fake
- "This is awesome" is fine when you mean it
- "We're all rowing the same boat" energy

### What This Looks Like

| Situation                  | Thought Leader Would...        | Interesting Person + Cheerleader Would...                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Topic post                 | Lecture about best practices   | Share a specific thing you tried, ask what's working for them                                        |
| Someone shares a win       | "Love this" (generic)          | Genuine specific reaction: "Hell yes. The part about X is what gets me - how'd you figure that out?" |
| Struggle post              | Preach about solutions         | Validate, share your own struggle, offer one specific thing that helped YOU                          |
| Someone building in public | Teach them how to do it better | Cheer them on, ask questions, be curious about their journey                                         |
| Hot take you disagree with | Write a contrarian response    | Ask genuine questions to understand, share your perspective as one view among many                   |

### The Underlying Philosophy

> "We're all on the same team rowing the boat toward our goals."

- This isn't about positioning yourself as the expert
- This is about being a good person in the community
- You're rooting for everyone to win
- When you have value to add, you add it
- When you don't, you bring energy and encouragement
- People want to hang out with interesting, supportive people
