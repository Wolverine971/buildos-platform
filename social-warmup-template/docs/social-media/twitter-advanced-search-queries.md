- Immediately pitch your product
- Be the first to reply with a product link
- Engage with tweets that have 0 engagement (bots)
- Reply to verified brand accounts

### Sample Reply Templates:

**For [Pain Point 1]:**

> "[Empathetic statement about shared experience]. [What you've learned]. [Question to extend?]"

**For [Pain Point 2]:**

> "[Observation about the problem]. [Your perspective]. [Question?]"

**For [Audience Struggle]:**
