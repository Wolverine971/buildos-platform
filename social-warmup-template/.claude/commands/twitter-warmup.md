## Phase 1: Load Context

### Read These Files (Required)

1. **Founder Context** (shared across platforms):
   - `docs/social-media/FOUNDER_CONTEXT.md`

2. **Voice Reference** (platform-specific):
   - `docs/social-media/twitter-voice-quick-ref.md`

3. **Engagement Targets** (accounts to scan):
   - `docs/social-media/twitter-engagement-targets.md`

4. **Search Queries** (for topic searches):
   - `docs/social-media/twitter-advanced-search-queries.md`

5. **Profile Database** (detailed account info):
   - `docs/social-media/profiles/INDEX.md`

### Check for Duplicates

Scan the last 7 days of engagement docs to avoid suggesting posts already seen:
- `docs/social-media/daily-engagement/` (all files from last 7 days)

Extract tweet links from previous docs and maintain a "seen" list.

---

## Phase 2: Browser Scanning

### Scan Order (Comprehensive)

**Round 1: Tier 1 Accounts (High Priority)**
Scan these profiles for posts from last 24 hours:
<!-- FILL IN from your engagement-targets.md -->

**Round 2: Tier 2 Accounts (Your Niche)**
<!-- FILL IN from your engagement-targets.md - organize by category -->

**Round 3: Topic Searches**
Use Twitter's search (Latest tab) with queries from:
`docs/social-media/twitter-advanced-search-queries.md`

**Round 4: Following Feed Discovery (New Accounts)**
Navigate to https://x.com/home (Following tab) and scroll through recent posts to discover:
- Accounts posting relevant content that aren't in Tier 1/2/3 lists
- People you follow who are actively discussing your topics
- Fresh voices with good engagement who align with your themes

### New Account Discovery Criteria

**Flag accounts for potential Tier addition if they:**
- Post about topics relevant to your niche
- Have 1K-100K followers (sweet spot for engagement)
- Post consistently (multiple times per week)
- Have good engagement ratios (replies/likes relative to followers)
- Write in a voice that resonates with your audience
- Are builders, founders, or practitioners (not just commentators)

**Capture for each discovered account:**
- Handle and name
- Follower count
- Bio summary
- Why they're relevant (content themes)
- Recent post that caught your attention
- Suggested tier placement (1, 2, or 3)

### For Each Potential Tweet, Capture:

- Author handle and name
- Tweet text (full content)
- Post age (how long ago)
- Current engagement (replies, likes, retweets)
- Link to tweet
- Why it's relevant (which content pillar it matches)

### Selection Criteria

**Include tweets that are:**
- From last 24 hours (prioritize <6h for freshness)
- Relevant to your content pillars
- Low-to-moderate existing replies (better chance to stand out)
- NOT already in the "seen" list from previous 7 days

**Skip tweets that:**
- Are promotional/ads
- Already have 100+ replies (too crowded)
- Are just announcements with no discussion angle
- You've already seen in previous docs

---

## Phase 3: Prioritize & Score

Score each tweet opportunity (1-10):

| Factor | Weight | Criteria |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Freshness | 3x | <2h = 10, 2-6h = 8, 6-12h = 6, 12-24h = 4 |
| Brand Fit | 3x | How aligned with your messaging |
| Engagement Potential | 2x | Author reach + topic interest |
| Reply Competition | 2x | Fewer replies = higher score |

Select **top 5-7 opportunities** based on total score.

---

## Phase 4: Generate Replies

For each selected tweet, create 2-3 reply options following the founder's voice:

### The Core Philosophy: Interesting Guy + Cheerleader

> **NOT a thought leader.** Everyone is trying to be a thought leader. That's overdone and inauthentic.
> **The goal:** Come across as an interesting person who has interesting things to say, OR as a genuine supporter when you don't have specific expertise.

### Two Modes of Engagement

**Mode 1: Add Value (When You Have Something)**
Use when the topic touches actual experience from the Founder Context.
- Share specific experience or insight
- Lead with curiosity, not authority
- Offer a perspective others might not have considered
- Be direct and lowercase casual

**Mode 2: Cheerleader (When You Don't)**
Use when you don't have specific expertise but want to engage.
- Genuine hype and encouragement
- Ask curious questions
- Celebrate their wins specifically
- "We're all rowing the same boat" energy
- It's valid to just be excited for someone

### Reply Generation Rules

1. **Decide your mode first** - Do you have value to add, or are you here to support?
2. **Lead with insight OR genuine excitement** - Both are valid, not just insight
3. **Use specific experience when relevant** - From the Founder Context document
4. **Product angle** - When relevant, frame around your core thesis IF natural
5. **Be direct** - Cut filler words, lowercase casual
6. **Teammate energy** - We're in this together
7. **Product mentions** - Only when genuinely relevant, use "shameless plug" framing
8. **It's okay to just encourage** - Not every reply needs to teach something

### Reply Templates by Topic

<!-- These will be filled based on your content pillars from FOUNDER_CONTEXT.md -->

**Niche Topic Posts - Value Mode:**
```
[observation from your experience]

[your specific experience relevant to this]

[question to extend the conversation]
```

**Niche Topic Posts - Cheerleader Mode:**
```
[genuine reaction to what they're sharing]

[curious question about their approach]
```

**Someone Sharing a Win:**
```
hell yes. [specific thing about the win that's impressive].

[curious question or genuine hype]
```

**Big Account Engagement:**
```
[reference their past content or framework]

[add unique angle from your experience OR genuine curiosity]

[ask a direct question - not generic praise]
```

## Voice Reminder

### The Philosophy
**Interesting person + cheerleader. NOT a thought leader.**

### Two Modes
1. **Value Mode:** When you have experience to share - lead with insight, be specific, ask smart questions
2. **Cheerleader Mode:** When you don't - genuine hype, curious questions, celebrate their wins

### The 3 Rules (for Value Mode)
1. Can I visualize it? (specific details)
2. Can I falsify it? (real experience)
3. Can nobody else say this? (unique perspective)

### Quick Do's
- Genuine excitement when cheering someone on
- "hell yes" and specific praise for wins
- Curious questions about their journey
- Teammate energy - we're all rowing together

### Quick Don'ts
- "love this" or "great post" (hollow)
- Preachy setups ("Most people don't realize...")
- Generic observations anyone could make
- Teaching when you're just supporting
- Thought leader energy
