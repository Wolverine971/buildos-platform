## Competitor Monitoring (PRIORITY)

**Check these accounts FIRST every scan. Monitor for:**
- New features they're shipping (can we incorporate?)
- Content strategy and positioning
- Community response and engagement patterns
- Partnership opportunities or collaboration potential
- Weaknesses we can address

### Direct Competitors

| Account | Product | Why Monitor | Strategy |
|---------|---------|-------------|----------|
| @dannypostma (103K) | PostmaOS - AI Life OS | Direct competitor, building similar vision | Learn from features, differentiate on ADHD focus |
| @danidonovan (126.3K) | Anti-Planner | Competing ADHD philosophy (no structure) | Respect, don't attack. Potential partnership. |
| @tdinh_me (61.5K) | TypingMind | AI chat UI, Claude power user | Watch for productivity features |

### Context Engineering Space (Own This Term)

| Account | Relevance | Why Monitor | Strategy |
|---------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| @dexhorthy (3.2K) | Coined "Context Engineering" | LAND GRAB - he owns the term | Engage, credit, build relationship |
| @datachaz (16.7K) | 16-page Claude guide | Deep context engineering practitioner | Learn from, cite, engage |
| @NinaLopatina | Works at ContextualAI | Industry insider | Monitor for trends |

### What to Look For

**When scanning competitors:**
1. **New features announced** - Can BuildOS implement better?
2. **User complaints** - Pain points we can solve
3. **Pricing changes** - Market positioning shifts
4. **Partnership announcements** - Who are they working with?
5. **Community sentiment** - Are users happy or frustrated?

**When scanning Context Engineering accounts:**
1. **New definitions/frameworks** - Incorporate into our narrative
2. **Viral threads** - Engagement opportunities
3. **Technical insights** - Product improvement ideas

**Flag anything notable in the daily engagement doc under "Competitor Intelligence" section.**

## Phase 1: Load Context

### Read These Files (Required)

1. **Founder Context** (shared across platforms):
   - `docs/marketing/social-media/FOUNDER_CONTEXT.md`

2. **Voice Reference** (platform-specific):
   - `docs/marketing/social-media/twitter-voice-quick-ref.md`

3. **Engagement Targets** (accounts to scan):
   - `docs/marketing/social-media/twitter-engagement-targets.md`

4. **Search Queries** (for topic searches):
   - `docs/marketing/social-media/twitter-advanced-search-queries.md`

5. **Twitter Profile Database** (detailed account info):

### Check for Duplicates

Scan the last 7 days of engagement docs to avoid suggesting posts already seen:
- `docs/marketing/social-media/daily-engagement/` (all files from last 7 days)

Extract tweet links from previous docs and maintain a "seen" list.

**Round 8: Following Feed Discovery (New Accounts)**
Navigate to https://x.com/home (Following tab) and scroll through recent posts to discover:
- Accounts posting relevant content that aren't in Tier 1/2/3 lists
- People you follow who are actively discussing AI, productivity, ADHD, or building
- Fresh voices with good engagement who align with BuildOS themes

### New Account Discovery Criteria

**Flag accounts for potential Tier addition if they:**
- Post about AI tools, context, productivity, or ADHD
- Have 1K-100K followers (sweet spot for engagement)
- Post consistently (multiple times per week)
- Have good engagement ratios (replies/likes relative to followers)
- Write in a voice that resonates with your audience
- Are builders, founders, or practitioners (not just commentators)

**Capture for each discovered account:**
- Handle and name
- Follower count
- Bio summary
- Why they're relevant (content themes)
- Recent post that caught your attention
- Suggested tier placement (1, 2, or 3)

### For Each Potential Tweet, Capture:

- Author handle and name
- Tweet text (full content)
- Post age (how long ago)
- Current engagement (replies, likes, retweets)
- Link to tweet
- Why it's relevant (which content pillar it matches)

### Selection Criteria

**Include tweets that are:**
- From last 24 hours (prioritize <6h for freshness)
- Relevant to: AI/context, ADHD/productivity, building in public, tool frustration
- Low-to-moderate existing replies (better chance to stand out)
- NOT already in the "seen" list from previous 7 days

**Skip tweets that:**
- Are promotional/ads
- Already have 100+ replies (too crowded)
- Are just announcements with no discussion angle
- You've already seen in previous docs

---

## Phase 3: Prioritize & Score

Score each tweet opportunity (1-10):

| Factor | Weight | Criteria |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Freshness | 3x | <2h = 10, 2-6h = 8, 6-12h = 6, 12-24h = 4 |
| Brand Fit | 3x | How aligned with BuildOS messaging |
| Engagement Potential | 2x | Author reach + topic interest |
| Reply Competition | 2x | Fewer replies = higher score |

Select **top 5-7 opportunities** based on total score.

---

## Phase 4: Generate Replies

For each selected tweet, create 2-3 reply options following DJ's voice:

### The Core Philosophy: Interesting Guy + Cheerleader

> **NOT a thought leader.** Everyone is trying to be a thought leader. That's overdone and inauthentic.
> **The goal:** Come across as an interesting person who has interesting things to say, OR as a genuine supporter when you don't have specific expertise.

### Two Modes of Engagement

**Mode 1: Add Value (When You Have Something)**
Use when the topic touches your actual experience - Curri integrations, BuildOS, Marines, context engineering, solo founder journey.
- Share specific experience or insight
- Lead with curiosity, not authority
- Offer a perspective others might not have considered
- Be direct and lowercase casual

**Mode 2: Cheerleader (When You Don't)**
Use when you don't have specific expertise but want to engage.
- Genuine hype and encouragement
- Ask curious questions
- Celebrate their wins specifically
- "We're all rowing the same boat" energy
- It's valid to just be excited for someone

### Reply Generation Rules

1. **Decide your mode first** - Do you have value to add, or are you here to support?
2. **Lead with insight OR genuine excitement** - Both are valid, not just insight
3. **Use specific experience when relevant** - Marines (sparingly), solo founder journey, Curri integrations
4. **Context engineering angle** - When discussing AI, frame around memory/context IF relevant
5. **Be direct** - Cut filler words, lowercase casual
6. **Teammate energy** - We're in this together
7. **BuildOS mentions** - Only when genuinely relevant, use "shameless plug" framing
8. **It's okay to just encourage** - Not every reply needs to teach something

## Voice Reminder

### The Philosophy
**Interesting guy + cheerleader. NOT a thought leader.**

### Two Modes
1. **Value Mode:** When you have experience to share - lead with insight, be specific, ask smart questions
2. **Cheerleader Mode:** When you don't - genuine hype, curious questions, celebrate their wins

### The 3 Rules (for Value Mode)
1. Can I visualize it? (specific details)
2. Can I falsify it? (real experience)
3. Can nobody else say this? (unique perspective)

### Quick Do's
- Genuine excitement when cheering someone on
- "hell yes" and specific praise for wins
- Curious questions about their journey
- Teammate energy - we're all rowing together

### Quick Don'ts
- "love this" or "great post" (hollow)
- Preachy setups ("Most people don't realize...")
- Generic observations anyone could make
- Teaching when you're just supporting
- Thought leader energy

---

**Created:** [timestamp]
**Next Scan:** [tomorrow's date]

## Execution Notes

5. **Quality over quantity** - better to find 5 great opportunities than 10 mediocre ones
