# Twitter Warmup - Daily Engagement Scan

You are conducting a daily Twitter/X engagement scan for @djwayne3 to find high-quality reply opportunities that align with the BuildOS brand.

## Output

Create a daily engagement doc at:
`docs/marketing/social-media/daily-engagement/YYYY-MM-DD_twitter-warmup.md`

## Phase 1: Load Context

### Read These Files (Required)

1. **Voice Reference** (compact):
   - `docs/marketing/social-media/twitter-voice-quick-ref.md`

2. **Engagement Targets** (accounts to scan):
   - `docs/marketing/social-media/twitter-engagement-targets.md`

3. **Search Queries** (for topic searches):

### Check for Duplicates

Scan the last 7 days of engagement docs to avoid suggesting posts already seen:

Extract tweet links from previous docs and maintain a "seen" list.

**Round 7: Following Feed Discovery (New Accounts)**
Navigate to https://x.com/home (Following tab) and scroll through recent posts to discover:
- Accounts posting relevant content that aren't in Tier 1/2/3 lists
- People you follow who are actively discussing AI, productivity, ADHD, or building
- Fresh voices with good engagement who align with BuildOS themes

### New Account Discovery Criteria

**Flag accounts for potential Tier addition if they:**
- Post about AI tools, context, productivity, or ADHD
- Have 1K-100K followers (sweet spot for engagement)
- Post consistently (multiple times per week)
- Have good engagement ratios (replies/likes relative to followers)
- Write in a voice that resonates with your audience
- Are builders, founders, or practitioners (not just commentators)

**Capture for each discovered account:**
- Handle and name
- Follower count
- Bio summary
- Why they're relevant (content themes)
- Recent post that caught your attention
- Suggested tier placement (1, 2, or 3)

### For Each Potential Tweet, Capture:

- Author handle and name
- Tweet text (full content)
- Post age (how long ago)
- Current engagement (replies, likes, retweets)
- Link to tweet
- Why it's relevant (which content pillar it matches)

### Selection Criteria

**Include tweets that are:**
- From last 24 hours (prioritize <6h for freshness)
- Relevant to: AI/context, ADHD/productivity, building in public, tool frustration
- Low-to-moderate existing replies (better chance to stand out)
- NOT already in the "seen" list from previous 7 days

**Skip tweets that:**
- Are promotional/ads
- Already have 100+ replies (too crowded)
- Are just announcements with no discussion angle
- You've already seen in previous docs

---

## Phase 3: Prioritize & Score

Score each tweet opportunity (1-10):

| Factor | Weight | Criteria |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Freshness | 3x | <2h = 10, 2-6h = 8, 6-12h = 6, 12-24h = 4 |
| Brand Fit | 3x | How aligned with BuildOS messaging |
| Engagement Potential | 2x | Author reach + topic interest |
| Reply Competition | 2x | Fewer replies = higher score |

Select **top 5-7 opportunities** based on total score.

---

## Phase 4: Generate Replies

For each selected tweet, create 2-3 reply options following DJ's voice:

### Reply Generation Rules

1. **Lead with insight, not agreement** - No "love this" or "great point"
2. **Use specific experience** - Marines, ADHD, solo founder journey
3. **Context engineering angle** - When discussing AI, frame around memory/context
4. **Be direct** - Cut filler words, lowercase casual
5. **BuildOS mentions** - Only when genuinely relevant, use "shameless plug" framing

### Reply Templates by Topic

**AI/Context Posts:**
```
[observation about AI memory problem]

[your experience or what you're seeing]

[optional: soft BuildOS mention if natural]
```

**ADHD/Productivity Posts:**
```
[validate the struggle with specific detail]

[what actually works / what you've learned]

[optional: ADHD brain reference]
```

**Building/Startup Posts:**
```
[direct reaction or agreement]

[add your experience - marines, solo founder]

[extend their point with your angle]
```

**Big Account Engagement:**
```
[reference their past content or framework]

[ask a direct question OR add unique angle]

[optional: tie to your BuildOS journey]
```
