please look at my twitter workflow starting with this command here .claude/commands/twitter-warmup.mdI want you to analyze my strategy and find 100 new people for me to engage with on twitter who have similar stats to me. I want to form a cohort of people who are at my level who would be interested in me and what I am building. Check and analyze twitter and find the people for me to engage with and give me their stats and their bio details like i do in these twitter files. Create a new folder for this bucket of peers that i should engage with docs/marketing/social-media/twitter-profiles
