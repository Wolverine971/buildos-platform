# Tools for Thought Rocks: April 2022 - Maggie Appleton, Hunter Clarke

**Source:** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6uhvFGPUE0)
**Host:** Tools for Thought Rocks
**Speakers:** Maggie Appleton, Hunter Clarke
**Date:** April 29, 2022
**Topic:** Tools for thought as cultural systems; FlowPilot demo

---

## Overview

This session has two parts. Maggie Appleton reframes tools for thought as cultural systems and argues that computation is a meta-medium that encodes practices. Hunter Clarke demos FlowPilot, a tool that fuses divergent ideation with convergent execution and discusses how structure, pruning, and momentum affect creative work.

## Key Insights & Takeaways

1. Tools for thought are primarily practices, not software artifacts.
2. Computation is a meta-medium that can reconfigure practices, but it is not the practice itself.
3. End-user programming and modular blocks let communities encode their own rituals.
4. The field over-indexes on text-based knowledge work and under-serves visual, embodied, and simulation-based thinking.
5. Synthesis and idea generation are the weakest links in current tools.
6. Creative work needs both divergence (explore) and convergence (execute).
7. Momentum comes from small steps; pruning completed or abandoned paths reduces cognitive drag.

## Part 1: Maggie Appleton - Tools for Thought as Cultural Systems

### The Label Is a Community, Not a Definition

Maggie frames tools for thought as a gathering point for multiple communities: PKM, CSCW/HCI, knowledge graphs, and experimental interface design. The phrase now functions as a software category, but the words themselves do not imply computation.

### Historical Tools for Thought Are Practices

Canonical definitions (Matuschak and Nielsen, Alan Kay) describe tools for thought as contexts that enable new kinds of thinking, not as apps. Most historical examples predate computers: writing, numerals, oral poetry, maps, Cartesian coordinates, data visualization.

### Practices vs Apps

Many current tools primarily implement older practices such as Zettelkasten and spaced repetition. The open question is whether the software is the real enabler or the practice itself. The tool may be an environment, but the practice is the unit that changes thinking.

### Computational Media for Thought (CMFT)

Maggie proposes the term "computational media for thought" as a clearer subset: computation is a distinct medium, but it is still a medium. Alan Kay's argument frames computing as a meta-medium that can simulate other media and expand degrees of freedom for representation.

### End-User Programming as Cultural Encoding

Examples like Roam smart blocks show that non-programmers will encode their own workflows when given the right primitives. Maggie highlights "programmable notes" as a way to embed question sequences, writing checklists, and idea prompts directly into tools.

### Gaps in Current Tools

Most tools optimize for capture, organization, retrieval, and memory. Synthesis and idea generation remain under-supported. The dominant tooling also targets text-heavy knowledge work, leaving out visual, embodied, oral, and simulation-based cognition.

### Expand the Field Beyond Text

She points to rich tools in other domains (Logic Pro for music, 3D game design pipelines, generative image tools) as examples of powerful computational media for thought that the community rarely references.

### Three Paths to Diversification

1. Deep participant observation with expert practitioners in real contexts.
2. User-generated plugins and blocks that let communities encode their own practices.
3. Mining history and cognitive science for cultural practices that have not yet crossed into software.

### Block Protocol

Maggie plugs the Block Protocol as an interoperability effort for block-based interfaces. The aim is to separate blocks from apps so independent developers can build specialized blocks that work across tools.

## Part 2: Q&A Themes From Maggie's Session

### Dissemination Matters as Much as Software

Participants argue that tool success depends on teaching the practice, not just shipping features. Community-driven documentation and peer teaching often outperform official guides.

### Passive vs Active Tools

A recurring theme is the spectrum between open-ended mediums and opinionated tools. The right balance lets users explore without getting lost or overly constrained.

### The Field Is Older Than the Current Hype

Attendees note that tools for thought existed long before recent VC attention (Tinderbox, enterprise knowledge management). The current wave is a public and cultural shift, not the first invention.

### Recovering Lost Practices

There is frustration with rebranding old practices under new marketing terms (for example, "second brain"). The group calls for deeper historical literacy and more explicit practice transfer.

## Part 3: Hunter Clarke - FlowPilot and the "Digital Kitchen"

### The Problem: Creative Work Is Not Linear

Hunter frames creative work as a messy, nonlinear process that alternates between divergence (generating possibilities) and convergence (executing a chosen path). Most people overestimate how linear the path will be.

### The Tool Gap: Gardens vs Project Managers

Digital gardens support divergent thinking and growth. Project management tools enforce convergence via rigid task trees. Hunter argues we need a hybrid.

### The "Digital Kitchen" Concept

A kitchen holds ingredients and tools, but its purpose is a finished meal. The digital kitchen pairs exploration with structured execution and encourages pruning as work progresses.

### FlowPilot Mechanics

FlowPilot starts with a goal and journaling. Users create tasks inline, drill into subtasks, and visualize the project as a tree or map. Completed or canceled tasks are minimized but preserved, keeping rationale without clutter.

### Why It Matters

FlowPilot creates momentum through small steps, makes "start with the end in mind" explicit, and treats cancellation as a valuable decision rather than waste.

---

## Part 4: Q&A Themes From Hunter's Session

### Starting With the End Is Hard

Users often discover that defining the goal is itself a task. Journaling provides an on-ramp to flow before committing to specific tasks.

### Notes vs Tasks Is a False Split

The group notes that most note tools handle tasks poorly and most task tools ignore context. The missing middle is a system that lets notes and tasks live together without losing structure.

### Directionality and Anxiety

The layout of task trees affects user anxiety. Directionality can signal forward progress, but too much structure can feel brittle for creative work.

## BuildOS Implications

### 1. Build Practices, Not Just Features

BuildOS should treat practices as first-class objects. A "Practice Library" and user-authored rituals would align with the cultural-systems framing.

### 2. Support Divergence and Convergence

Pair brain dumps (divergent) with structured execution (convergent). Provide modes or views that emphasize exploration versus next actions.

### 3. Prune Without Losing Memory

Adopt FlowPilot's idea of minimizing completed or canceled branches while preserving rationale. This keeps focus on the next step without erasing context.

### 4. Move Beyond Text-Only Thinking

Add multi-modal thinking surfaces: timelines, spatial maps, and simulation-friendly views. This expands the tool beyond white-collar text workflows.

### 5. Invest in Synthesis and Generation

Tools for thought are weakest at synthesis. BuildOS should prioritize cross-linking, comparison, and structured idea generation, not only capture and retrieval.

### 6. Teach the Practice

Onboarding should teach methods, not just features. Community-shared workflows and visible examples are part of the product, not marketing extras.
