## The Vision of Malleable Software

### Why Malleability Matters

Geoffrey finds it "almost painful when people can't change their surroundings, their environments, tools." The inability to modify software represents a loss of agency:

> "That person is lacking agency and has been robbed of something really important."

The core insight came from working at an education startup:

> "On feedback calls, people would say a lot of stuff was missing or wrong. Sometimes it was tiny stuff, like, 'Could you change this one word in the UI? Because at our school, that word is really contentious.' Something I learned working at a startup is that usually, you're supposed to say no."

**The Problem:** Mass-produced software can't serve individual needs.

> "People know what they need. The only reason we don't give it to them is because we assume this kind of mass-produced product."

### Environments Shape Us

The deeper concern is cultural:

> "If we spend all our time in platforms that dictate every detail for us, a way of thinking might be lost. That's really scary to me."

> "The best environments come from adaptation. When the people living or working in a space pay attention to their own needs and gradually evolve to meet those needs. The result is beauty and quality."

**Key Insight:** Christopher Alexander's idea - don't build the whole house. Build part of it, start living in it, wait and see. As things come up, evolve it over time.

> "That way of thinking to be how a lot of the best things come to be in the world. They're iterative. The irony is that's really hard to do with bricks or wood. It should be easier with the digital, plastic idea of code."

## Spreadsheet Thinking - The Gold Standard

### What Makes Spreadsheets Great

Spreadsheets are "one of the greatest inventions in software history" because:

1. **No forced use case** - Just gives you a bag of ingredients
2. **Combinable primitives** - Learn cells, formulas, colors; apply to anything
3. **Low floor, high ceiling** - Don't need expertise to get started
4. **Informality** - Can express things before they're ready to be categorized
5. **Shared workspace** - Expert and novice work in the same space

> "Spreadsheets are really, really good at allowing informality... You can sketch anything, and even if you don't know quite where it fits, or even if you don't know how to write it down in words, you can express it."

### The Problem with Most Software

> "A lot of software forces you into premature formalism of how you think about something."

**Example:** Travel planning apps have a database schema. If your thoughts don't fit that schema, you're stuck.

> "They have a database schema, and if your thoughts don't fit into that schema for what they think a trip is, you're screwed."

**The Solution:** Start unstructured, add structure gradually as needed.

> "We started from something that looks more like an Apple Note or an Obsidian note, where you're just writing stuff down about what you want to do, and it's completely unstructured. Then, can you gradually start giving it a little bit of structure, just as much as you need?"

---

## The Gentle Slope

### The Cliff Problem

Most software has a "cliff" - past a certain point, you need to learn exponentially more to make incremental changes.

> "Past this point, good luck; you're going to have to learn to program or something. They call that a cliff because you have to instantly learn a ton more stuff to make one more step forward."

**Physical Space Analogy:**

> "Obviously, there's a big difference between moving a Post-it note, moving a desk, and moving a wall. Those are not the same thing. Physical space often has a reasonably gentle slope. To move a desk, I don't need to hire a general contractor."

> "In software, the way this analogy applies is as if you had to hire a construction crew to move a Post-it note or something."

### The Gentle Slope Principle

> "The idea of the gentle slope is if you want to do something that's a little more complex or more involved, you should only need to learn a little bit more stuff or go a little bit deeper."

**The Goal:** Linear relationship between effort and capability.

> "It doesn't mean things aren't ever hard. It doesn't mean you can magically do everything easily. All it means is that easy, simple stuff shouldn't be ridiculously complicated."

### The Nightmare Bicycle

A critique of oversimplified interfaces that hide understanding:

> "On this bicycle, the gear shifters are not numbers; they are buttons with modes on them. Gravel mode, uphill mode, downhill mode, puddle mode. It comes with a manual that says if you're going uphill, hit 'uphill.'"

The problem: When you encounter something new (downhill on gravel), those four buttons haven't taught you anything about how it works under the hood.

> "Bike gears are not that hard to understand. Most people can figure it out just fine... Maybe it's actually better to expose more of this mechanism so that people can surreptitiously develop that understanding."

---

## Tools Over Apps

### The LEGO Metaphor

> "The vision of malleable software is not that everyone should build everything from scratch. That would be an enormous waste of time."

> "When someone gives me a LEGO set, and I love 95% of it, but I hate that that turret is in that position, it's no problem. I just take the turret off and move it. It's built out of pieces I already know how to use."

### Apps as Avocado Slicers

> "Apps are avocado slicers. This ridiculous tool that has three parts that are all good at slicing an avocado. Just learn to use a chef's knife. You will be so much better for it."

**The Kitchen Problem:**

> "A fluid workflow where all your tools and materials are always at hand is impossible in the world of big box applications. It's as though you have to carry ingredients from one end of the kitchen to another every time you want to use a tool."

### Mix and Match

> "There are certain app categories I really care about; let's take email. I have found so many email clients that are 80% of what I want, but they're each a different 80%. I keep thinking to myself, if I could just have the categorizing algorithm from one and the inbox view from another, that would be the perfect email client."

**Physical World Comparison:**

> "You can swap in a different knife, a different cutting board, and different pots and pans; it's a pretty modular thing... But in software, we tend towards these big monolithic things instead of starting from more modular pieces."

---

## User Empowerment & Agency

### The Agency Philosophy

> "I have an axiomatic belief that most people are pretty plastic on this dimension. Every experience that you have where you do something and it matters enforces the idea that what you do matters. Every experience that you have where you try to do something and you're not allowed to or it doesn't matter, reinforces the idea that what you do doesn't matter."

### Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

> "If every teenager lives in their iPhone and you can't change anything in your iPhone, then there'll be a self-fulfilling prophecy of this pessimistic view of people as passive consumers."

> "Customizing software in this way is an uphill battle because the tools and infrastructure that we use to develop and deploy software treat users as passive recipients rather than active co-creators."

### The Steve Jobs Insight

> "There's a famous Steve Jobs quote: 'Everything around you was invented by someone sort of just like you.' That's a really exciting way to think about things."

### Feedback Loops Shape Behavior

> "To take the DoorDash example, what you're fighting against is a company who's incentivized to make you forget that delivery food is not the only option. They want you to think, 'Oh, I have a thousand choices. What I'm supposed to do is pick one of the thousand choices, and I'm good.'"

---

## LLMs and the Future of Software

### AI as a Lever for Malleability

> "AI and LLMs are a significant lever to help make more software malleable, as in theory, anyone can edit code at the speed of thought."

**Real Example:** Geoffrey built a word-count outline tool in 5 minutes while writing an essay:

> "I tabbed over to my AI-assisted IDE and said, 'I want a view of the essay I'm writing with an outline and word counts.' A couple of minutes later, it was done."

### The Sous Chef Analogy

> "AI is a sous chef. AI is this intern, maybe a brilliant chef, whom you've now hired for 20 bucks a month to help you out. You bring the sous chef to the food court; what are they going to do? You're still stuck ordering from the menu. They don't have access to the kitchen."

**The Point:** AI coding alone isn't enough. You need:

- Open source software (necessary but not sufficient)
- A place for new tools to live (an operating system)
- Ways to compose tools together

> "The whole point is that you do your AI coding, take the thing it built, bring it into your kitchen, and combine it with the stuff you already have."

### ChatGPT as Muse, Not Oracle

> "What if we were to think of LLMs not as tools for answering questions, but as tools for asking us questions and inspiring our creativity? Could they serve as on-demand conversation partners for helping us to develop our best thoughts as a creative muse?"

**Practical Technique:**

> "A very common thing I do is say, 'Ask me questions about what I'm thinking before telling me your thoughts.' Or a simple technique I like is to say, 'Give me 20 options, not one or three.' Because with LLMs, the speed and breadth of generation is a huge asset."

### AI as Local Developer

> "I'm really enamored by this idea that the local developer could be your AI. That has all these nice consequences where the goal might be that you end up not using the AI anymore. If your local AI teaches you all the spreadsheet stuff you need to know, you don't need them anymore."

---

## The Local Developer

### Who Are Local Developers?

> "Another one that I like is software handyman. This local person knows more than you - maybe a little, maybe a lot more - but isn't a construction crew. They're a mid-tier person. Probably, you could learn to do most of what they do if you owned a home, cared, and learned it."

**The Excel Expert Pattern:**

> "Studying spreadsheet use at companies, Bonnie Nardi found local developers, amateur enthusiasts who could write bits of code for their coworkers and guide their team up a gentle slope of spreadsheets."

### What Makes Spreadsheets Work for Local Developers

1. **Novice can still do a lot** - Enter all the numbers, only ask for help on formulas
2. **Shared workspace** - Expert works in the same space you already work in
3. **Visible work** - "It's not magic; it's all there"
4. **Tacit transfer** - Can pick up formulas, copy-paste, learn over time

> "To put a point on it, in software, often what you have is the lobby where you work. Then, if you want anything changed, there's some hidden boiler room somewhere, which is the code that you never see."

### The 1% to 10% Problem

> "1% of people can build software today. We don't need to get it to 100; we just need to get it to 10%. That 10% is going to be distributed across every profession and every corner of the world. We just need those local experts to learn enough to do useful stuff."

## Design Principles for Malleability

### Popping Open the Hood

Alan Kay's vision: "Pop open the hood of software and see what's inside"

> "He wants people to be able to edit their tools the way they edit their documents. He says, here's how you do it: You have people use the thing, and surreptitiously, as they use it, they're accidentally learning how it works."

**The Goal:** The moment something is wrong or doesn't work the way you want, you've already developed the knowledge to fix it.

### The Recipe vs. Final Dish

> "Foam is more like a recipe than a final dish. A recipe tells you a good combination of ingredients, and you get to make the food yourself, substituting ingredients to your liking along the way."

> "Yes, the restaurant food is truly better in many ways, and there's a role for restaurants in society. But I wouldn't want to live in a world where no one cooks and food is something we can only choose off a menu. Software is increasingly heading to that place."

### Home-Cooked Meals

> "Your pie doesn't need to be original."

Every creation doesn't need to be compared to every other creation - it serves a personal purpose.

### Empathy and User Understanding

> "I'm pretty pessimistic that it's possible to design truly great software for someone other than yourself, especially if that person is operating in a complex environment."

> "In some domains, the problem is obvious, and the solution is really hard. But in my experience, most design is the opposite. The hard part is understanding the needs, and the solutions follow naturally, maybe with a bit of editing from a pro."

## The Future of Software

### Where Ergonomics Still Matter

> "Chat will never feel like driving a car, no matter how good the bot is."

Better framing: "Chat will never feel like holding a paintbrush."

**When to use chat:**

- Fuzzy intent
- Clear objectives (Waymo-style delegation)
- Verifiable, optimizable outcomes

**When direct manipulation wins:**

- Precision work
- Creative exploration
- Visual/spatial tasks

> "Direct manipulation - by which I mean clicking on stuff and moving things, this metaphor of the screen having objects on it that you can think about - engages a different part of our brain."

### Hybrid Modalities

> "An idea that I'm obsessed with is hybrid voice and pointing. I want to, Minority Report style, use my fingers and my voice simultaneously."

### What AI Will Automate

> "Any subtask that has a very clear criteria for what success looks like is going to be automated. The tasks that are left for me to work on are the ones where we don't know what the answer is."

### The Value of Being Involved

> "When you're trying to do certain kinds of creative work, being involved in the details is the only way to get to the unique output that would have come from you, and there's no shortcut."

> "One way I think about it is if I'm doing serious work, I don't think there's a way to reduce the amount of time I'm spending on it. That's not my goal. It's more, can I ramp up the quality of the time I'm spending so that every minute is focused on the important bits?"

## Key Quotes

### On Agency

> "Everyone deserves the right to evolve their digital environments. It's the only way to fulfill our creative potential and maintain a sense of agency in a world that increasingly resides in software."

### On Software Today

> "Many small tweaks - taping a Post-it note to the wall, rearranging some drawers, moving a piece of furniture - can be done instantly without asking anyone's permission. We can also take on larger changes that require more effort and skill. We work and live in a physical space that we can control."

### On the Dream

> "This is the dream of malleable software: editing software at the speed of thought."

### On the Medium

> "Computers are probably the only tool we've ever invented that are a universal simulator. It's a meta-medium that can do anything. The ceiling on how cool that could be for people, in terms of our ability to think and create, is so high, and we're so far from hitting it."

### On Human Nature

> "Often people respond to this vision by saying, 'Man, you're being very optimistic about human nature. People don't want this.' If you're talking short term, you totally might be right. However, I really believe that people respond to their culture and their environment in terms of how much agency we feel."

### On Making

> "If you're going to make anything, why not make it wonderful? Showing people you care or expressing your care through things you make is a lovely way to live."

## BuildOS Implications

### For Brain Dump System

1. **Start Unstructured, Add Structure Gradually**
    - Brain dumps should allow complete informality
    - Structure emerges from use, not upfront
    - "Gradually start giving it a little bit of structure, just as much as you need"

2. **Avoid Premature Formalism**
    - Don't force thoughts into rigid project/task schema immediately
    - Let users express things before they're ready to be categorized
    - The travel planning example: start like Apple Notes, add structure optionally

3. **The Spreadsheet Model**
    - Simple primitives that combine into complex outcomes
    - Low floor (anyone can dump thoughts) + high ceiling (sophisticated organization)
    - Shared workspace between user and AI

### For AI-Powered Features

1. **AI as Local Developer**
    - AI should work in the same space as the user
    - Make AI's work visible and editable
    - Goal: user learns from AI, eventually needs it less

2. **ChatGPT as Muse**
    - Use AI to ask questions, not just answer them
    - "Ask me questions about what I'm thinking before telling me your thoughts"
    - Generate 20 options, not 3 - let users apply taste

3. **Editing at Speed of Thought**
    - 5-minute tool creation should be the norm
    - Stay in flow - if it takes an hour, momentum is lost
    - "There's a critical threshold: if you can stay in flow and change something, then it becomes worth doing"

### For ADHD Users

1. **The Gentle Slope is Critical**
    - Cognitive load must scale linearly with complexity
    - No cliffs - every step forward should require only slightly more effort
    - "Easy, simple stuff shouldn't be ridiculously complicated"

2. **Agency Builds Agency**
    - Every successful interaction reinforces sense of control
    - Make early wins easy and visible
    - "Every experience that you have where you do something and it matters enforces the idea that what you do matters"

3. **Don't Require Understanding Upfront**
    - Surreptitiously learn how system works through use
    - Avoid nightmare bicycle - don't hide mechanics behind "smart" buttons
    - Let users "pop open the hood" when ready

### For Product Design

1. **Tools Over Apps**
    - Build composable pieces, not monolithic features
    - Users should be able to mix-and-match functionality
    - Think chef's knife (versatile) not avocado slicer (single-purpose)

2. **The 10% Problem**
    - Not everyone needs to customize - but the 10% who want to should be able to
    - Build for local developers who can help their teams
    - These power users are distributed across every context

3. **Home-Cooked Meals Philosophy**
    - Personal software doesn't need to be "original" or compete
    - Serve the individual's specific needs
    - "A recipe tells you a good combination of ingredients, and you get to make the food yourself"

## Summary: Geoffrey Litt's Tenets

1. **Malleability is agency** - Control over tools = control over life
2. **Start unstructured** - Let structure emerge from use
3. **Build gentle slopes** - Linear effort-to-capability curve
4. **Tools, not apps** - Composable pieces over monoliths
5. **Pop open the hood** - Learn through using, fix through understanding
6. **AI as collaborator** - Work in shared space, make work visible
7. **Empowerment over delegation** - Goal is user capability, not dependency
8. **Local developers matter** - The 10% who help everyone else
9. **Speed enables flow** - 5-minute changes preserve momentum
10. **Agency begets agency** - Every win reinforces belief in control
