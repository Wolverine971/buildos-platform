# Plain-Language Summary

> **TL;DR:** LLMs are great at simple optimization tasks but fail badly when problems have many variables. This paper tests four strategies to inject domain knowledge and help LLMs handle complex problems.

---

## The Core Problem

**LLMs hit a wall when problems get complex.**

- **< 6 variables:** LLMs succeed 100% of the time
- **6-11 variables:** Success drops to 50%
- **> 11 variables:** LLMs basically fail—traditional statistical methods beat them

This matters because real-world software optimization often involves 14-38+ variables (database tuning, cloud configs, video encoding).

**Why?** Training data scarcity. The internet has plenty of simple config examples but few documented optimal solutions for complex, domain-specific systems.

---

## The Four Strategies

### 1. Human-in-the-Loop (H-DKP)

A 10-day feedback loop where experts critique LLM outputs daily. Key insight: experts don't write prompts—they explain _why failures happened_. "Recognition over recall" reduces cognitive load.

### 2. Multi-Stage Prompting (AMP)

Break optimization into stages: Analyze → Discover constraints → Generate → Self-validate. Forcing the LLM to "show its work" reduces hallucinations and constraint violations.

### 3. Progressive Dimension Expansion (DAPR)

Don't throw all 38 variables at once. Start with the 5 most important, optimize those, then progressively add more while anchoring new ones to working values. Like teaching someone to juggle—start with 2 balls, not 7.

### 4. Hybrid Statistical + LLM (HKMA)

Use fast statistical methods to "scout" patterns first, then use RAG to find documentation explaining _why_ those patterns exist. Stats find patterns, RAG finds explanations, LLM synthesizes.

---

## Practical Takeaways

1. **When LLMs struggle, check dimensionality.** Many variables = break it down.
2. **Multi-stage prompting works.** Ask "what are constraints?" → "what are tradeoffs?" → "given those, what should I do?"
3. **Human feedback is most valuable when explaining failures**, not providing solutions.
4. **Hybrid approaches are promising.** Ground LLMs with actual data before asking for quantitative decisions.
5. **Training data scarcity will worsen.** Research predicts LLMs exhaust text data by 2028. Domain knowledge injection becomes critical.

Abstract
Background/Context: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on low-dimensional software engineering optimization tasks (≤11 features) but consistently underperform
on high-dimensional problems where Bayesian methods dominate.
A fundamental gap exists in understanding how systematic integration of domain knowledge (whether from humans or automated
reasoning) can bridge this divide.
Objective/Aim: We compare human versus artificial intelligence strategies for generating domain knowledge. We systematically evaluate four distinct architectures to determine if structured
knowledge integration enables LLMs to generate effective warm
starts for high-dimensional optimization.
Method: We evaluate four approaches on MOOT1 datasets stratified by dimensionality: (1) Human-in-the-Loop Domain Knowledge
Prompting (H-DKP), utilizing asynchronous expert feedback loops;
(2) Adaptive Multi-Stage Prompting (AMP), implementing sequential constraint identification and validation; (3) Dimension-Aware
Progressive Refinement (DAPR), conducting optimization in progressively expanding feature subspaces; and (4) Hybrid KnowledgeModel Approach (HKMA), synthesizing statistical scouting (TPE)
with RAG-enhanced prompting. Performance is quantified via Chebyshev distance to optimal solutions and ranked using Scott-Knott
clustering against an established baseline for LLM generated warm
starts.
Note that all human studies conducted as part of this study will
comply with the policies of our local Institutional Review Board.

1 Introduction
Software engineering optimization requires balancing competing
objectives (e.g. runtime versus memory, quality versus cost, speed
versus energy consumption). Active learning addresses these problems efficiently by using models to select the most informative
examples to label, achieving good results with minimal data [40].
However, to learn good optimizations from data, some ground
truth data must initially be available. In the domain of software
engineering, obtaining these labels is often prohibitively expensive
or time-consuming [43, 24].
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a potential solution for
generating these initial “warm start” samples without the cost of
execution. Yet, their reliability in this domain is debated; Treude
et al. [3] conclude that LLMs function best as assistive rather than
1Available at: tiny.cc/moot
authoritative agents in software tasks. Conversely, insights from
Nair et al. [34] on “bad learners” suggest that even imperfect models can successfully guide optimization if they can suggest valid
partial rankings. This raises a critical question: can we leverage the
assistive nature of LLMs to act as heuristic guides for optimization,
even if they lack authoritative ground truth?
Recent work [40] studying dozens of SE optimization problems
demonstrates that LLMs can indeed generate effective warm starts,
reducing labeling requirements from hundreds to dozens of examples. On low-dimensional problems (< 6 features), LLM-based
warm starts achieve top performance 100% of the time. On mediumdimensional problems (6-11 features), they succeed 50% of the time.
However, performance collapses for high-dimensional problems
(> 11 features), where traditional Bayesian methods like Gaussian Process Models remain superior. This dimensional barrier is
problematic: many real-world SE optimization tasks in the MOOT
[29] repository involve more than 11 features, including software
configuration (18-38 features), process modeling (23 features), and
hyperparameter tuning (14-38 features).
The cause of this failure likely stems from training data limitations. LLMs excel on “common” problems well-represented in their
training corpus but struggle with specialized, high-dimensional
SE tasks that lack abundant public examples. Cloud configuration,
aerospace software processes, and domain-specific optimizations
rarely have publicly documented optimal solutions. Without sufficient training data, LLMs cannot learn the complex feature interactions that characterize high-dimensional spaces. This problem
will intensify: recent projections suggest LLMs will exhaust available textual training data by 2028, making data-scarce optimization
domains increasingly important [44]. No prior work has systematically explored whether injecting domain-specific knowledge can
overcome these limitations.
We propose four complementary approaches to incorporate domain knowledge into LLM warm starts, moving from human-centric
to fully automated strategies:
(1) Human-in-the-Loop Domain Knowledge Prompting
(H-DKP): We leverage human experts to verify and refine constraints in an iterative loop, augmenting prompts
with structured feature relationships and heuristics at three
levels of detail.
(2) Adaptive Multi-Stage Prompting (AMP): We decompose
the generation process into sequential reasoning stages:
analysis, constraint identification, generation, and validation. We allow the LLM to generate its own knowledge
before proposing solutions.
(3) Dimension-Aware Progressive Refinement (DAPR):
We address high-dimensional complexity by optimizing

Srinivasan et al.
in reduced feature spaces (identified via statistical ranking) and progressively expanding dimensions, effectively
guiding the LLM through the search space.
(4) Hybrid Knowledge-Model Approach (HKMA): We employ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [25] combined with rapid statistical exploration using Tree of Parzen
Estimators (TPE) [5] to leverage both data-driven patterns
and semantic understanding from online texts and documentation.
We will evaluate all approaches on MOOT multi-objective SE
optimization tasks stratified by dimensionality.
2 Related Work
Modern software engineering is characterized by massive parameter search spaces that must be configured [7]. Xu et al. [47] and
Van Aken et al. [4] report that as systems mature, these spaces
explode exponentially. Consequently, users often ignore configuration options or rely on obsolete defaults, which can lead to significant performance degradations (up to 480× in some industrial
cases [13, 18, 20]). To manage this complexity, researchers employ
configuration optimization algorithms to balance competing constraints [17]. In the realm of software analytics, such optimization is
critical; studies by Fu et al. [14] and Agrawal et al. [1] demonstrate
that optimizing learners (e.g., finding hyperparameter settings) can
fundamentally alter experimental conclusions, turning a "worst"
performing algorithm into the "best" [42, 2, 49, 48].
Despite the necessity of optimization, practical application is
hindered by the high cost of data collection. Exploring configuration
landscapes for systems like x264 can require thousands of hours
of compile time [43], necessitating low-resource approaches that
operate within strict budgets of fewer than 50 evaluations [35, 9]. To
maximize efficiency within these limits, researchers utilize iterative
refinement algorithms [30, 52] and Active Learning [38]. However,
these methods are sensitive to initialization; poor "cold starts" waste
the limited labeling budget. The standard solution has historically
been "warm starting" the optimization using prior knowledge from
Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) [16, 26, 50].
While effective, reliance on human SMEs is not scalable across
the diverse ecosystem of modern software libraries. Recent work
attempted to use Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated
proxies for SMEs to generate these warm starts [40]. However, these
initial studies reveal a critical "dimensional barrier": while LLMs
perform well on simple, low-dimensional tasks, their performance
collapses on high-dimensional, multi-objective tabular data (> 11
features), often performing worse than random sampling.
3 Research Questions
• RQ1 (Comparative Efficacy): Which domain knowledge
integration strategy (HDKP, AMP, DAPR, HKMA) yields the
highest quality warm starts compared to standard baselines
across the MOOT corpus?
• RQ2 (The Dimensional Barrier): How does the effectiveness of each strategy vary across dimensionality tiers?
• RQ3 (The Human Factor): Does human-in-the-loop feedback (H-DKP) provide statistically significant performance
gains over the fully automated methods?
• RQ4 (Cost-Benefit Analysis): What are the quantitative
trade-offs between solution quality improvements and computational overhead for each approach?
• RQ5 (Knowledge Attribution): Which specific categories
of domain knowledge (structural constraints, feature correlations, heuristics, or statistical priors) contribute most to
performance improvements?
4 Data Sources & Collection
4.1 The MOOT Repository
To evaluate our hypotheses, we utilize MOOT, a curated repository
of software engineering optimization datasets. These datasets come
from papers published in top SE venues such as the International
Conference on Software Engineering [10, 45, 31, 15], Foundations
of SE (FSE) conference [34, 21] IEEE Trans. SE [11, 46, 24, 6, 23],
the Information Software Technology journal [8, 14], Empirical
Softw. Eng. [19, 36, 22], Mining Software Repositories [32], IEEE
Access [27], ACM Trans. SE Methodologies [28] and the Automated
Software Engineering Journal [33]. The repository currently houses
over 120 datasets spanning diverse domains, including real-world
system traces and software process simulations. Table. 1 provides a
summary of the datasets in MOOT.
4.1.1 Dataset Selection and Stratification. From this corpus, we
curate a representative subset to form our experimental testbed.
We enforce a selection criterion of at least 10 datasets per complexity tier to ensure generalizability across the dimensionality
spectrum in accordance with prior work [40]:
• Low Dimensionality (< 6 features): Simple configuration tasks where LLMs historically perform well.
• Medium Dimensionality (6 − 11 features): Intermediate
complexity tasks.
• High Dimensionality (> 11 features): Complex, sparse
landscapes where prior work indicates LLMs fail.
This selection strategy is designed to balance statistical power
with economic constraints. Our study requires four distinct knowledge integration methods (plus baselines) executed 20 independent
trials across datasets. Due to costs associated with high-volume API
access for state-of-the-art LLMs, analyzing the entire repository is
infeasible. By restricting our testbed to a stratified subset, we ensure
sufficient statistical power to detect the "dimensional barrier" while
managing API costs.
The final column of Table 1 indicates the feasibility of recruitment for the H-DKP protocol. Datasets marked with a ✓indicate
domains where Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) are accessible either
locally at the NC State campus or through our direct academic
network. This accessibility filter will serve as a secondary criterion
when choosing datasets from MOOT for H-DKP.
4.2 Participants: Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
We will recruit human experts following approval from the North
Carolina State University Institutional Review Board (IRB). We classify this study as “Minimal Risk” regarding human subjects, as data
collection is limited to professional email correspondence regarding

populations.
4.2.1 Recruitment Channels and Criteria. We leverage the extensive industry connections of the NC State Computer Science Department, where many graduates have remained in the Research
Triangle Park area for over a decade. Through the departmental
alumni group, advisory board, and faculty contacts, we will conduct a targeted email campaign to identify qualified experts. Based
on prior experience with similar SE surveys, we anticipate a response rate of 2-10%. To achieve our target of at least one expert per
dataset category, we plan to issue approximately 500 recruitment
requests. We will conduct a pilot study with two experts local to
the university to calibrate expert time commitment before wider
recruitment.
We define a qualified Subject Matter Expert (SME) based on
meeting at least one of the following criteria:
• Primary Authorship: Authors of the original research
papers contributing datasets to the MOOT repository.
• Project Maintenance: Active maintainers or core contributors to the specific software systems under consideration.
Gold Standard Vetting: For experts who are not primary
authors or known maintainers, we will administer a brief
"Gold Standard" questionnaire containing 7 multiple choice
questions about the domain. These questions will focus
on specific, non-obvious domain constraints found in the
documentation. Only participants who correctly answer
these control questions will be admitted to the study.
4.2.2 Contingency for Dropouts and Asynchronous Responses. We
recognize that expert availability is variable. Therefore, we adopt a
flexible Asynchronous Iterative Protocol:
• Non-Consecutive Iterations: The experimental design
requires 𝑇 logical feedback iterations, not 𝑇 consecutive
calendar days. Experts may respond at their own pace; the
LLM state remains frozen until feedback is received.
• Minimum Viable Threshold (𝑇𝑚𝑖𝑛): To ensure statistical
validity, we establish a minimum threshold of 𝑇𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 5
iterations. Datasets where experts provide fewer than 5
feedback cycles will be excluded from the H-DKP specific
analysis.
• Variable 𝑇 Analysis: We anticipate that the final number
of iterations 𝑇 will vary across datasets (e.g., 5 ≤ 𝑇 ≤
10). We pre-register an analysis to correlate the number
of expert feedback rounds (𝑇 ) with the final optimization
improvement (Δ Chebyshev distance). This allows us to
quantify the marginal utility of human effort (e.g., "Does
performance plateau after 𝑇 = 7?").
5 Analysis Plan & Evaluation Criteria
5.1 Baseline Methods
We will compare our methods against the following warm start
baselines:
3
Srinivasan et al.
• Random Sampling (Random): A naive baseline that selects samples uniformly at random from the search space.
This establishes the lower bound of performance.
• Gaussian Process Model (UCB_GPM): The current stateof-the-art for high-dimensional optimization in this domain.
We use a Gaussian Process regressor with the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) [41] acquisition function.
• Standard LLM Warm Start (BS_LLM): Prior state-ofthe-art few-shot prompting approach where the LLM is
provided with 4 randomly selected examples (labeled as
"Best" or "Rest") and basic feature metadata (name, type,
median) [40]. This serves as our primary control to measure
improvements from domain knowledge integration.
5.2 Primary Metric: Chebyshev Distance
We quantify the quality of generated warm starts using the Chebyshev distance to the optimal configuration as done in prior work
[40]. Since objectives in software optimization often have vastly
different scales, we first normalize all objective values 𝑦𝑖 to the
range [0, 1]. The Chebyshev distance 𝐷 for a candidate solution 𝑥
is defined as:
𝐷(𝑥) = max
𝑖∈ {1,...,𝑚}
(|𝑓𝑖(𝑥) − 𝑧
∗
𝑖
|) (1)
Where 𝑚 is the number of objectives and 𝑧
∗
𝑖
is the ideal value (0
for minimization) for the 𝑖-th objective. A lower Chebyshev distance
indicates a solution closer to the theoretical optimum. We perform
our experiments for 20 trials across each method (in H-DKP, the
final prompt is used 20 times to generate warm starts). For each
trial, we report the minimum Chebyshev distance achieved among
the generated warm start examples.
5.3 Secondary Metrics
5.3.1 Generated Example Diversity. To ensure the LLM is not simply generating identical variations of one good example, we measure the diversity of the generated set E𝑔𝑒𝑛. We calculate the Average
Pairwise Euclidean Distance between all generated vectors in the
feature space. Higher diversity implies better exploration of the
search space.
5.3.2 Computational Cost (API Tokens). We track the economic
feasibility of each method by logging the total number of input
and output tokens consumed per trial. We report the average cost
per successful warm start. This allows us to analyze the tradeoff
between performance gains and the increased inference cost relative
to the single-shot baseline.
5.4 Statistical Analysis: Scott-Knott and Effect
Size
To determine if our proposed methods provide a statistically significant improvement over the baseline, we employ the Scott-Knott
Effect Size Difference (ESD) test.
5.4.1 Scott-Knott Clustering Algorithm. The Scott-Knott algorithm
[39] recursively partitions the set of treatment means into two
subsets to maximize the difference between groups. The splitting
criterion maximizes the Between-Group Sum of Squares (𝐵0). For a
set of treatments with sizes 𝑁1 and 𝑁2 and sums of responses 𝑇1
and 𝑇2, the algorithm seeks a partition that maximizes:
𝐵0 =
𝑇
2
1
𝑁1

- 𝑇
  2
  2
  𝑁2
  −
  (𝑇1 +𝑇2)
  2
  𝑁1 + 𝑁2
  (2)
  The algorithm follows these steps:
  (1) Sort: Order the treatment distributions by their median
  Chebyshev distance.
  (2) Split: Identify the partition point that yields the maximum
  𝐵0.
  (3) Significance Test: Check if the split is statistically significant using a bootstrap sampling method (to avoid assumptions of normality).
  (4) Effect Size Check (ESD): Even if significant, the split is
  rejected if the magnitude of the difference is negligible
  (Cliff’s Delta < 0.147). This ensures distinct ranks represent
  practically meaningful differences.
  (5) Recurse: If the split is valid, recursively apply the procedure to each subgroup; otherwise, terminate and group the
  treatments into a single rank.
  5.4.2 Effect Size (Cliff’s Delta). To ensure that observed differences
  are not just statistically significant but practically meaningful, we
  calculate Cliff’s Delta [12] (𝛿), a non-parametric effect size measure.
  We interpret the magnitude of difference between the proposed
  method and the baseline as follows:
  • |𝛿 | < 0.147: Negligible
  • 0.147 ≤ |𝛿 | < 0.33: Small
  • 0.33 ≤ |𝛿 | < 0.474: Medium
  • |𝛿 | ≥ 0.474: Large
  We consider a hypothesis validated only if the proposed method
  achieves a better Scott-Knott rank and shows at least a "Small"
  effect size improvement over the BS_LLM baseline.
  6 Methods & Execution Plan
  6.1 Human-in-the-Loop Domain Knowledge
  Prompting (H-DKP)
  6.1.1 Overview and Rationale. While LLMs can parse documentation, they lack the tacit knowledge possessed by domain experts
  (unwritten rules, edge cases, and intuition gained through experience). We propose Human-in-the-Loop Domain Knowledge
  Prompting (H-DKP), a methodology to extract this tacit knowledge through a structured, asynchronous dialogue with human experts. Unlike static few-shot prompting, H-DKP treats the prompt
  construction as an iterative software design process, evolving the
  LLM’s "mental model" of the domain over a fixed time window. The
  process is outlined in Algorithm 1.
  6.1.2 Expert Recruitment and Elicitation Protocol. To execute HDKP, we will identify and recruit domain experts for the datasets in
  the MOOT repository as outlined previously. To minimize expert
  cognitive load, we utilize the Recognition over Recall principle. Experts will not be asked to write prompts. Instead, they will critique
  the LLM’s outputs.
  6.1.3 The 10-Day Iterative Refinement Sprint. We employ an Asynchronous Iterative Refinement (AIR) protocol. For a period of
  4
  Beyond the Prompt: Assessing Domain Knowledge Strategies for High-Dimensional LLM Optimization in Software Engineering
  10 consecutive days, each expert engages in a daily feedback loop
  with the LLM.
  • Day 1 (Initialization): The LLM generates an initial “Belief
  State” (hypothesized constraints and feature relationships)
  based on documentation about the data, variable names and
  problem objectives.This is sent to the expert for a baseline
  validity check (Valid/Invalid/Modify).
  • Days 2-9 (The Feedback Loop): Each day, we run the
  current Prompt State to generate warm start configurations.
  We identify the “Most Confusing Failure”—a configuration
  the LLM predicted would be optimal but which performed
  poorly in reality. The expert receives a structured email
  containing:
  (1) The current rule set the LLM is following.
  (2) The specific failure case (e.g., "The model set ‘threads=100‘
  expecting high throughput, but latency spiked.").
  (3) A single question: "What domain rule is the model missing that explains this failure?"
  The expert’s email reply is parsed and appended to the
  prompt context for the next day’s run.
  • Day 10 (Finalization): The accumulated knowledge base
  is frozen and used for the final experimental evaluation.

  6.1.4 H-DKP analysis consideration. Given the nature of human
  studies and mercurial nature of expert recruitment, we do not anticipate our analysis with H-DKP to span across all datasets used
  in the other discussed methods. We will restrict our comparison of
  H-DKP and other algorithms only for datasets where the study is
  completed with an expert without dropout.
  6.2 Adaptive Multi-Stage Prompting (AMP)
  6.2.1 Overview and Rationale. Standard "single-shot" prompting
  treats optimization as a pattern-matching task, asking the LLM to
  generate solutions immediately after seeing a few examples. We
  propose Adaptive Multi-Stage Prompting (AMP), a sequential
  reasoning pipeline that forces the LLM to explicitly articulate its
  "mental model" of the optimization landscape before generating
  configuration values. By separating analysis from generation, AMP
  aims to reduce the logical inconsistencies and constraint violations
  common in single-shot warm starts.
  6.2.2 Stage 1: Analysis. The first stage functions as a filter to distinguish signal from noise. The LLM is provided with dataset metadata
  (feature names, types, ranges) and the initial few-shot examples. It
  is prompted to output a structured analysis identifying:
  (1) Feature Ranking: A prioritized list of the 3-5 most influential features driving the objective values.
  (2) Tradeoff Identification: Explicit notes on conflicting objectives observed in the few-shot examples.
  (3) Directionality: The hypothesized direction of improvement for continuous variables.
  6.2.3 Stage 2: Constraint Discovery. Using the analysis from Stage
  1, the LLM infers explicit boundaries for valid configurations. This
  stage distinguishes between:
  • Hard Constraints: Inviolable rules based on physical or
  logical limits (e.g., "parallel_threads cannot exceed available
  cpu_cores").
  • Soft Constraints: Heuristic preferences that generally lead
  to better outcomes but may be violated for exploration.
  We expect that explicitly generating these rules will reduce the
  search space for the subsequent generation step and provide a
  "rulebook" for the validation stage.
  6.2.4 Stage 3: Constrained Generation. The third stage performs
  the actual warm start generation. Unlike the baseline single-shot
  approach, the prompt for this stage is dynamically constructed to
  include the prioritized Feature List (from Stage 1) and the Validation
  Rules (from Stage 2) as strict instructions. The LLM is tasked to
  generate configurations that optimize the identified key features
  while strictly adhering to the discovered hard constraints.
  6.2.5 Stage 4: Self-Validation. In the final stage, the LLM acts as
  a critic. It reviews its own generated configurations against the
  constraint set defined in Stage 2.
  • Verification: Each generated example is checked for strict
  logical consistency based on the generated constraints.
  • Refinement: If a configuration violates a hard constraint,
  the model is prompted to revise the specific value while
  preserving the rest of the configuration.
  6.2.6 AMP Ablation study. To study the effect of the different strategies for prompting the LLM to decipher knowledge we will study the
  various stages in 3 experimental conditions: Condition 1 (AMP-2):
  Analysis + Generation, Condition 2 (AMP-3): Analysis + Constraints
- Generation & Condition 3 (AMP-4): Full 4-stage pipeline.

  Srinivasan et al.
  6.3 Dimension-Aware Progressive Refinement
  (DAPR)
  6.3.1 Feature Importance Ranking. To minimize possible bias and
  failures of specific methods, we propose feature importance calculation through 3 different statistical methods - Spearman coefficient,
  mutual information & feature importance calculated through random forest. The calculated values through these methods will then
  be normalized and averaged to calculate the final feature importance
  score. It is to be noted that this calculation will only be performed
  with the few-shot samples random chosen as knowledge for the
  LLM.
  6.3.2 Progressive Expansion Algorithm. The progressive refinement
  portion of DAPR, as illustrated in Algorithm. 2, begins by initializing
  the current feature set 𝜒𝑐𝑢𝑟with the top 𝑘 most important features
  (line 2). At each iteration, the algorithm projects four random examples onto the current reduced subspace (line 4) and prompts
  the LLM to generate optimized configurations using only these
  features (line 5). Generated examples are mapped to their nearest
  neighbors (following the methodology in prior work [37, 51]) in the
  full dataset to obtain labels (lines 6-8), and the best configuration
  is tracked across iterations (lines 9-12). The feature space is then
  progressively expanded by adding the next 𝑠 most important features (lines 13-14), with newly added features anchored to values
  from the current best configuration to maintain continuity (lines
  15-17). This process repeats until all 𝑛 features are included. Finally,
  the algorithm generates warm start examples in the full dimensional space, using the best configuration found during progressive
  refinement as an anchor point (lines 18-20).

  6.4 Hybrid Knowledge-Model Approach
  (HKMA)
  6.4.1 Overview and Rationale. We posit that LLMs and statistical
  models suffer from orthogonal blind spots: LLMs possess semantic understanding but hallucinate quantitative relationships, while
  Bayesian models (like TPE) identify quantitative patterns but lack
  semantic causal reasoning. HKMA bridges this gap using a lightweight statistical model to "scout" the terrain and identify empirical
  priors, which are then fed to the LLM to ground its generation in
  observed reality.
  6.4.2 Phase 1: Statistical Scouting. Before invoking the LLM, we
  perform a rapid, low-budget exploration using the Tree-structured
  Parzen Estimator (TPE). We allocate a small "scouting budget"
  (𝐵𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 10) to perform a rapid exploration of the search space using TPE. We specifically utilize the TPE exploit capability to quickly
  identify high-performing regions versus low-performing ones. By
  comparing the distribution of the top-performing configurations
  (𝑆𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡 ) against the remaining samples (𝑆𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡 ), we extract Empirical
  Priors. These priors are formalized as natural language descriptions
  of observed phenomena, such as directional trends and boundary
  conditions.
  6.4.3 Phase 2: Retrieval-Augmented Synthesis. We employ RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG) to provide semantic context for the
  observed statistical patterns. We index the domain documentation
  and academic literature collected from the MOOT repository into a
  vector store.Using the extracted Empirical Priors as search queries,
  we retrieve relevant documentation that explains the physical or
  logical mechanisms behind the statistics (e.g., querying "Why does
  high buffer size improve throughput?" to retrieve specific memory management docs). The final prompt to the LLM constructs a
  synthesis task: the model is provided with the Empirical Evidence
  and the Semantic Explanation, and is tasked with generating warm
  start configurations that satisfy both.
  6.4.4 Study design and ablation. We plan to ablate the RAG and
  scouting phases by using them separately and together to understand the implication of these treatments on the quality of warm
  starts generated.
