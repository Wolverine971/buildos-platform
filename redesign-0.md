The style in your image blends a few recognizable visual traditions. The closest umbrella terms are:

## **1. Halftone Illustration**

- The dotted shading you see (circular or stippled dots grouped into tonal areas) is characteristic of **halftone printing**, originally used in newspapers and comics to simulate gradients with solid ink.
- This is especially common in **retro comic art**, **screenprinting**, and **pop-art–adjacent design**.

## **2. Linocut / Woodcut–Inspired Graphics**

- The bold **black-and-white contrast**, **thick organic linework**, and **carved-looking shapes** mimic the appearance of **linocut** or **woodcut prints**.
- Many modern designers mix halftone textures into a linocut layout for a hybrid vintage look.

## **3. Screenprint Texture / Graphic Pattern Art**

- The repeating floral shapes and strong silhouettes also resemble **screenprint pattern design**, often used in band posters, surf/skate brands, and modern street-art graphics.
