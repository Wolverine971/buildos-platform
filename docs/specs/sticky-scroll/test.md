# Instructor Bio Questionnaire

Use this to collect missing information for each instructor's page. Phil's page is the template—we want that level of detail for everyone.

---

## What We're Looking For

Each instructor page should have:

1. **Background** - Life before the Marines (where they grew up, what they were into, first exposure to shooting if any)
2. **Marine Corps Timeline** - Key dates, units, roles, deployments
3. **The Link-Up Story** - How they connected with Phil/The Cadre (these are the juicy details people remember)
4. **Training & Courses** - Formal schools, certifications, competition results
5. **Techniques & Teaching Insights** - Lightbulb moments, things they learned the hard way, tips they always give students (these are gold for content)
6. **Current Setup** - What rifle(s) they're running, components, why they chose them
7. **What They're Doing Now** - Competitions, training, other work

- **"My passion is teaching and I just happen to teach my hobby"**
- **"Focus on the task at hand"** - don't worry about Phase 2 when you're inxPhase 1
- **Build foundation at 100 yards** before introducing external ballistics
- **Define your definition of success** with a precision rifle, then date it and track how it evolves
- **Positional Triangle** - evolved from bone support/muscular relaxation/natural point of aim to stability/comfort/recoil management

## Techniques & Teaching Insights (From Transcripts):

- **Centerline buttstock moment (2016)**: Dry firing at home with Downing, took overhead photos and realized they were both crooked. Moved buttstock to collar bone, tried it at schoolhouse next day - "literally after all those sights settled my reticle landed right back on that pasty at 100 yards. I had never understood recoil management until that very moment."
- **West Coast highest pass rates**: During his time as instructor, his program had the highest marksmanship pass rates in the sniper pipeline

## How to Use This

1. **Send to each instructor** or use as interview guide
2. **Record answers** as voice memos or written responses
3. **Flag the best stories** for the "About" section
4. **Build timelines** from the dates they provide
5. **Get rifle specs** exactly—people care about this

The goal: Every instructor page should feel as personal and detailed as Phil's. The "accidentally became a sniper" story is what makes Phil's page memorable. Each person has their version of that story—we just need to pull it out.
