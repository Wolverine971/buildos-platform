# BuildOS Archive Documentation

> **Historical documentation and research materials preserved for reference**

This archive contains important historical documentation that is no longer actively maintained but should be preserved for future reference.

## What's in This Archive

### `/brain-dump-docs/` - Brain Dump Feature Research

Historical research and specifications for the brain dump feature.

**Contents:**

- `braindump-refactor-2025.md` - Refactoring plans
- `braindump-calendar-sync-research.md` - Calendar integration research
- `braindump-deletion-feature-plan.md` - Feature planning

- `2025-01-08_google_calendars_for_projects.md` - Calendar integration research

## When to Use This Archive

### ✅ Use archive docs when:

- Researching historical decisions
- Understanding evolution of features (brain dump, calendar sync)
- Looking for context on why certain approaches were taken
- Reviewing outdated development documentation

### ❌ Don't use archive docs for:

- Current feature implementation (use `/apps/web/docs/features/` instead)
- Active development guidance (use app-specific CLAUDE.md files)
- Current architecture decisions (use `/docs/architecture/`)
- Investor research (moved to `/docs/marketing/investors/`)

## Archive Organization Principles

1. **Preserve, Don't Delete** - Important research and decisions are archived, not removed
2. **Timestamped Context** - Archives include date context for historical reference
3. **Clear Labeling** - Archive status is clearly indicated in parent indexes
4. **Structured Storage** - Archives maintain logical organization by topic

## Related Current Documentation

For **active documentation**, see:

- **Current Marketing Strategy:** `/docs/marketing/`
- **Active Features:** `/apps/web/docs/features/`
- **Current Architecture:** `/docs/architecture/`
- **Development Guides:** `/apps/web/CLAUDE.md` and `/apps/worker/CLAUDE.md`

## Archival Policy

Documents are moved to archive when they:

- Represent completed research that informed decisions
- Document historical approaches no longer in use
- Contain valuable context but are not actively maintained
- Should be preserved for future reference
