# Fundraising Preparedness Checklist - Part 2: Action Plan & Refined Strategy

## ðŸš¨ Critical Priority: Get Incorporated TODAY

Anna, you need to incorporate immediately. This is blocking everything else. Without incorporation:

- You can't sign SAFEs or take investment
- You have personal liability for everything
- Investors won't even have initial conversations

**Action today**: Use Stripe Atlas ($500) or Clerky ($800 total) to form a Delaware C-Corp. This takes 1-2 hours and you'll have your company in 1-2 days.

## ðŸ“Š Your Traction Story Reframe

Your numbers need a better narrative:

- **81 signups â†’ 50 users â†’ 2 DAU** sounds like massive drop-off
- **Instead say**: "81 beta signups with controlled onboarding. Currently testing with power users to nail the experience before scaling."

## ðŸ’° Your Runway Problem

2 months runway is a red flag. Here's what to do:

**Option 1**: Raise a quick $50-100K from angels NOW (2-3 weeks)
**Option 2**: Get contract work for 2-3 months to extend runway
**Option 3**: Pre-sell annual subscriptions to beta users ($200/year x 25 users = $5K)

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Refined 30-Second Pitch

Your current pitch is too long. Here's a tighter version:

_"BuildOS is AI-first project management for people with ADHD and scattered thinkers. Users brain-dump their thoughts, and our AI automatically organizes them into actionable projects and tasks. We're replacing the 2 hours people spend organizing with 2 minutes of dumping thoughts. 81 signups in our first month with zero marketing spend."_

## ðŸ“ˆ This Week's Action Plan

### Day 1-2 (Urgent Legal/Financial):

1. **Incorporate via Stripe Atlas** (start this morning)
2. **Open Mercury bank account** (as soon as you have EIN)
3. **Extend your runway** - pick one:
   - Reach out to 10 angels for bridge funding
   - Offer 10 beta users lifetime deals for $500 each
   - Line up 1-2 months of contract work

### Day 3-4 (Materials):

1. **Create dead-simple 10-slide deck** using this template:
   - Slide 1: BuildOS - AI That Organizes Your Chaos
   - Slide 2: Problem: Knowledge workers waste 11 hours/week organizing
   - Slide 3: Solution: Dump thoughts â†’ AI organizes â†’ Projects appear
   - Slide 4: Demo screenshot showing transformation
   - Slide 5: Early traction: 81 signups, 2 power users giving daily feedback
   - Slide 6: Business model: $20/month SaaS, path to $50-200/seat enterprise
   - Slide 7: Market: 40M ADHD adults, 260M knowledge workers
   - Slide 8: Why me: Technical solo founder, personal pain point, shipping fast
   - Slide 9: Competition: We're AI-native vs retrofitted productivity tools
   - Slide 10: Raising $350K for 18 months runway + founding engineer

### Day 5-6 (Outreach Prep):

1. **Get 3 testimonials** from your 2 DAU (even short ones)
2. **Record 90-second demo** showing the magic moment
3. **Find 5 warm intros** through your network

## ðŸŽ² Your Best First Investors

Given your profile (solo, technical, $0 revenue, 2-month runway), target these investor types:

1. **ADHD/Neurodiversity Angels** - They'll get it immediately
2. **Developer Tools Angels** - They understand productivity pain
3. **Military Veteran Investors** - Instant connection
4. **Solo Founder Friendly** - Jason Calacanis, Sahil Lavingia types

## ðŸ’¡ The Killer Question Answers

When they ask **"Why isn't this just a ChatGPT wrapper?"**:
_"ChatGPT helps you write. We help you ship. Our value is in the organizational layer - understanding project structure, maintaining context across sessions, and turning chaos into executable plans. The LLM is just one component."_

When they ask **"What about the 2 DAU from 81 signups?"**:
_"We're intentionally keeping the beta small while we nail the core experience. Those 2 users use BuildOS daily and have given us 50+ pieces of feedback. We'd rather have 2 users who can't live without us than 80 who are lukewarm."_

## ðŸš€ Your "Unfair Advantage" Story

Refine this: _"I have ADHD myself and have tried every productivity tool. They all require you to be organized first. I'm building the tool I desperately needed - one that works with your chaos, not against it. Plus, my military background means I ship relentlessly and don't quit."_

## Next Steps & Key Questions:

1. Which runway extension option will you pursue this week?
2. Can you commit to incorporating by Friday?
3. What's blocking you from getting those 3 testimonials today?
4. Do you have any founder friends who've raised recently for warm intros?

The clock is ticking with 2 months runway. We need to move FAST but strategically. You ready to hustle?
