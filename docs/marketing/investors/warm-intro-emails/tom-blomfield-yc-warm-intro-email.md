# Tom Blomfield (Y Combinator) - Warm Introduction Email Template

## Investor Context

- **Fund**: Y Combinator (Group Partner since April 2023)
- **Background**: Oxford Law → GoCardless (YC S11) → Monzo → YC Partner
- **Investment Thesis**: AI acceleration, contrarian founders, international scalability
- **Connection Strength**: 85% - YC connection + AI productivity + international potential

### Specific Common Ground Opportunities

- **YC Alumni Bond**: Both went through YC program (his S11, yours S19) - shared understanding of the experience
- **Contrarian Approach**: Military questioning of conventional wisdom, his challenger bank vs. traditional banking
- **International Perspective**: Military deployment experience, his UK → global business expansion
- **Systematic Building**: Military operational procedures, his methodical approach to fintech innovation
- **Regulatory Navigation**: Military compliance culture, his experience with financial services regulations
- **Consumer-First Thinking**: Military focus on mission success, his consumer banking philosophy
- **Technical Integration**: Understanding complex system integration from both military and fintech perspectives
- **Rapid Execution**: Military decision-making speed, his startup velocity at Monzo

### How Tom Likely Feels About Current Market (Late 2024/Early 2025)

**AI Acceleration Validation**: "The latest YC batch proves AI is fundamentally changing startup economics. Teams of 5 engineers can now build what previously took 50. Military + YC backgrounds suggest you understand both systematic execution and rapid iteration."

**Founder Selection Evolution**: "YC selection criteria are evolving for the AI era. Looking for founders who combine technical depth with systematic thinking. Military operational experience could be a huge advantage in managing AI-powered development cycles."

**International AI Opportunity**: "AI productivity tools have global applicability, unlike fintech which requires local regulatory navigation. Military deployment experience suggests comfort with international operations and cultural adaptation."

**Contrarian Positioning Value**: "The best YC companies are often contrarian. Monzo succeeded by reimagining banking from first principles. AI-native productivity tools could similarly disrupt traditional project management approaches."

**YC Network Effects**: "YC alumni have massive advantages in this market - network effects, shared experiences, and mutual support. Military → YC → AI productivity could be compelling to other YC companies as customers."

**Speed vs. Deliberation**: "AI enables incredible development speed, but military training in systematic planning could prevent the chaos that destroys many fast-moving startups. The combination of speed and discipline is rare and valuable."

**Subject**: YC Alum Building AI-Native Productivity: Military → Curri → BuildOS

Hi Tom,

Your recent insights about AI making the latest YC batch the "fastest-growing ever" perfectly describe what we're experiencing at BuildOS.

I'm [Name], YC alum via Curri (S19) where I built integration systems connecting to Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. That experience taught me that the biggest productivity gains come from systematic coordination, not incremental features.

Now I'm building BuildOS - an AI-native productivity platform that, like the companies you mentioned, leverages AI to achieve more with smaller teams. We're not adding AI features to existing tools; we're rebuilding productivity workflows from first principles.

Your contrarian approach at Monzo (challenger bank disrupting traditional banking) mirrors our approach to productivity tools. Instead of competing feature-for-feature, we're creating entirely new workflows that leverage foundation models.

Early traction: [specific metric about AI-accelerated development or user productivity gains]

Would love to share what we're building and get your perspective on AI-native approaches to traditional software categories. Given YC's focus on international scalability, I think you'd appreciate our global market approach.

Brief call possible?

Best,
[Name]

YC S19 Alum (Curri)
BuildOS Founder
