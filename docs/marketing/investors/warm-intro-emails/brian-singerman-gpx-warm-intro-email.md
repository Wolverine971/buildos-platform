# Brian Singerman (GPx Fund) - Warm Introduction Email Template

## Investor Context

- **Fund**: GPx ($500M+ fund with Peter Thiel backing, launched 2025)
- **Background**: Stanford CS → Google → Founders Fund → GPx co-founder
- **Investment Thesis**: Complex coordination, upside maximization, contrarian approach
- **Connection Strength**: 80% - Complex coordination + contrarian positioning alignment

### Specific Common Ground Opportunities

- **Stanford CS Background**: Both understand computer science fundamentals and system design
- **Google Engineering Experience**: Appreciation for building systems at massive scale
- **Contrarian Thinking**: Military training in questioning conventional wisdom, his anti-consensus approach
- **Complex Systems**: Military operational coordination, his focus on complex coordination businesses
- **Technical Product Building**: Hands-on engineering experience, not just business strategy
- **Startup Execution**: Understanding rapid iteration and resource constraints
- **Long-term Vision**: Military strategic planning, his focus on transformative companies
- **Self-Awareness**: Military leadership training, his emphasis on founder self-knowledge

### How Brian Likely Feels About Current Market (Late 2024/Early 2025)

**Complex Coordination Scarcity**: "Most AI companies are solving simple problems with fancy technology. Real defensibility comes from complex coordination that competitors can't easily replicate. Military founders understand operational complexity in ways that most tech founders don't."

**Founder Quality Concerns**: "The easy money era produced too many founders who lack self-awareness and technical depth. Military + engineering backgrounds suggest both self-discipline and technical competence. The combination of systematic thinking and hands-on execution is rare."

**GPx Deployment Opportunity**: "Just launched GPx with significant capital and Peter's backing. Need to find exceptional founders building truly differentiated businesses. Military operational experience could translate to complex coordination advantages in civilian markets."

**AI Hype Skepticism**: "Everyone's building AI companies, but most lack real technical moats. Military founders understand the difference between technology demos and operationally robust systems. They've seen what happens when complex systems fail under pressure."

**Contrarian Positioning Value**: "The best opportunities right now are contrarian. Building AI-native productivity tools when everyone else is adding AI features could be like SpaceX when private rockets seemed impossible. Need founders with conviction to go against conventional wisdom."

**Upside Maximization Focus**: "In this environment, need to focus on truly transformative opportunities. Military founders who've transitioned successfully often have unique insights into systematic approaches that could create category-defining companies."

**Subject**: Complex Coordination Business: Military → YC → AI Productivity

Hi Brian,

Your investment philosophy around "complex coordination" and "upside maximization" aligns perfectly with what we're building. My experience creating multi-platform delivery systems at Curri taught me that the most defensible businesses orchestrate complex interactions that competitors can't easily replicate.

BuildOS does exactly this for productivity: we coordinate between natural language capture, AI processing, task management, calendar optimization, and team collaboration in ways that create compound advantages over time.

Like your contrarian SpaceX investment when private rockets seemed impossible, we're taking a contrarian approach to productivity - building AI-native from the ground up rather than adding features to existing tools.

Given GPx's focus on complex coordination businesses, I'd love to share our approach and get your perspective on what makes coordination truly defensible.

Not seeking investment immediately, but would value insights from someone who's backed transformative coordination platforms.

Brief conversation possible?

Best,

## Key Positioning Points

### Complex Coordination Elements

- **Multi-System Integration**: Natural language → AI → Tasks → Calendar → Collaboration
- **Compound Advantages**: Each component improves others over time
- **Competitive Moats**: Coordination complexity creates replication barriers
- **Network Effects**: User data improves AI, which improves coordination

### Contrarian Positioning

- **Against Trend**: Building AI-native vs. adding AI features
- **Market Timing**: Like SpaceX when rockets seemed impossible
- **Architecture Decision**: Ground-up rebuild vs. incremental improvement
- **Vision Scale**: Category creation vs. feature competition

### Follow-Up Strategy

1. **Week 1**: Send initial email
2. **Week 2**: If no response, share specific coordination architecture diagram
3. **Week 3**: Warm introduction through Founders Fund network
4. **Month 1**: Share BuildOS defensibility analysis and moat documentation

### Preparation Before Sending

- [ ] Document specific complex coordination elements in BuildOS
- [ ] Prepare contrarian positioning against traditional productivity tools
- [ ] Research GPx portfolio announcements and investment patterns
- [ ] Map potential warm introduction paths through Founders Fund network

### Expected Response Rate

**Medium-High (60-70%)** - New fund deployment phase, complex coordination thesis alignment, but very high standards for "exceptional founders."

## Alternative Subject Lines

- "Contrarian Productivity: Complex Coordination at Scale"
- "Military Systems Thinking → Complex Coordination Business"
- "AI-Native Productivity: The SpaceX Approach to Workflows"

## Complex Coordination Deep-Dive

- Map how each system component strengthens others
- Demonstrate why sequential/incremental approach wouldn't work
- Show network effects and data flywheel advantages
- Explain technical barriers to competitor replication

## GPx Fund Context

- **Fresh Deployment**: Fund launched 2025, actively investing
- **Hybrid Model**: 20% emerging manager investments, 80% Series B co-investments
- **Peter Thiel Backing**: Up to 50% fund capital from Thiel
- **Focus Areas**: Healthcare, defense tech, AI infrastructure, complex coordination

## Red Flags to Avoid

- Don't present theoretical moats (he wants existing defensibility)
- Avoid lack of self-awareness about strengths/weaknesses
- Don't undersell the coordination complexity
- Avoid virtue signaling about AI trends

## Contact Strategy

- **Best Approach**: Warm introduction through Founders Fund network
- **Alternative**: Direct LinkedIn with specific complex coordination angle
- **Timing**: Early 2026 when GPx is actively deploying capital
- **Follow-up**: Focus on coordination defensibility evidence
