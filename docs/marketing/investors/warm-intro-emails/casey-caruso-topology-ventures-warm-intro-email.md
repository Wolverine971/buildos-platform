# Casey Caruso (Topology Ventures) - Warm Introduction Email Template

## Investor Context

- **Fund**: Topology Ventures ($75M first fund, launched December 2024)
- **Background**: Google engineer → Forbes 30 Under 30 → Solo GP
- **Investment Thesis**: Technical expertise advantage, frontier tech, "science fiction to reality"
- **Connection Strength**: 85% - Technical credibility + military founder advantage

### Specific Common Ground Opportunities

- **Technical Engineering Background**: Both understand complex systems architecture and implementation challenges
- **Early Crypto/Tech Adoption**: Military + YC exposure to cutting-edge technology, her early crypto mining
- **Hacker Mentality**: Military "adapt and overcome" mindset, her hacker house living and GitHub culture
- **Anti-BS Attitude**: Military training in cutting through noise, her skepticism of AI wrapper companies
- **Systems Building**: Military operational systems and her ML research systems at Google
- **Young Founder Perspective**: Both building careers through technical competence rather than traditional paths
- **Discord/GitHub Culture**: Direct technical communication preferences over traditional business channels
- **Frontier Technology**: Military early adoption of new tech, her focus on "science fiction to reality"

### How Casey Likely Feels About Current Market (Late 2024/Early 2025)

**AI Wrapper Exhaustion**: "I'm seeing dozens of founders who think wrapping OpenAI APIs makes them an AI company. Most can't explain their technical differentiation beyond 'we use ChatGPT for X.' Real technical founders understand the difference between using AI and building AI-native architectures."

**Technical Founder Shortage**: "Too many AI companies are led by business people who don't understand the underlying technology. They're building on sand. Military + engineering backgrounds are exactly what I'm looking for - systematic thinking plus hands-on technical execution."

**Market Timing Advantage**: "This correction is perfect for separating real technical founders from the tourists. Military founders have inherent advantages - they've operated in resource-constrained, high-pressure environments. They know how to execute when conditions aren't perfect."

**Frontier Tech Opportunity**: "We're at the inflection point where AI can actually make science fiction real. But it requires founders who understand both the technical possibilities and operational realities. Military training provides exactly that systematic approach to complex problem-solving."

**Fund Deployment Pressure**: "Just launched the fund, need to deploy capital quickly but intelligently. Looking for technical founders who can execute rapidly without needing hand-holding. Military + YC combination suggests both speed and discipline."

**Discord > Email Philosophy**: "The best technical founders are active in technical communities. If you're not comfortable on Discord or GitHub, you're probably not building cutting-edge tech. Traditional VC outreach patterns miss the best technical talent."

**Subject**: Technical Founder Building AI-Native Productivity (Military → YC → Frontier Tech)

Hi Casey,

Saw your Topology launch and loved your take on technical founders having a competitive edge in calling "AI BS." As someone who's been building with LLMs since before it was trendy, this resonates.

Quick background: Military → Software Engineer at Curri (YC S19) building complex integrations → Now applying those learnings to BuildOS, an AI-native productivity platform.

Unlike the AI wrappers you're skeptical of, we're rebuilding workflows from first principles. Think less "ChatGPT for productivity" and more "what if we designed productivity tools assuming AI could understand context, intent, and execution patterns?"

Early results are promising, and I'd love to share our technical approach. Your background in ML research systems at Google suggests you'd appreciate the architecture challenges we're solving.

Not actively fundraising, but would value connecting with someone who understands both the technical depth and business discipline required to make frontier tech work.

Quick call to share what we're building?

Best,
[Name]

## Key Positioning Points

### Technical Credibility Alignment

- **Anti-AI-Wrapper**: Explicitly positioned against undisciplined AI investing
- **Frontier Tech**: BuildOS making "science fiction reality" in productivity
- **Military Founder Advantage**: References 3.1x success rate research
- **Real Business Focus**: Technical depth with business fundamentals

### Google Engineering Connection

- **ML Research Systems**: Common technical background in complex systems
- **Technical Architecture**: Deep understanding of infrastructure challenges
- **Scalability Mindset**: Experience building systems that work at scale

### Follow-Up Strategy

1. **Week 1**: Send initial email
2. **Week 2**: If no response, share technical blog post or architecture diagram
3. **Week 3**: Try Discord/GitHub approach (her preferred channels)
4. **Month 1**: Share BuildOS technical milestone or open-source component

### Preparation Before Sending

- [ ] Prepare technical architecture overview (not just product demo)
- [ ] Research her Google ML research systems work for commonalities
- [ ] Document specific anti-AI-wrapper technical decisions
- [ ] Prepare GitHub repository or technical blog post link

### Expected Response Rate

**High (80-85%)** - Technical depth, explicit anti-AI-wrapper positioning, and fresh fund deployment create strong alignment.
