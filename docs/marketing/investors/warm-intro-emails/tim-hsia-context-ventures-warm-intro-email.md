# Tim Hsia (Context Ventures) - Warm Introduction Email Template

## Investor Context

- **Fund**: Context Ventures (Military veteran founder focus)
- **Background**: West Point → Combat Infantry → Stanford MBA/JD
- **Investment Thesis**: Military-grade operational discipline for entrepreneurs
- **Connection Strength**: 95% - Perfect military-to-military alignment

### Specific Common Ground Opportunities

- **Military Academy Experience**: Both understand military discipline, honor code, and systematic thinking
- **Combat Deployment**: Shared experience of high-pressure decision-making and mission execution
- **Military-to-Tech Transition**: Both navigated the cultural shift from military to civilian entrepreneurship
- **Systems Thinking**: Military training in operational planning and systematic execution
- **Veteran Community**: Shared network and understanding of veteran entrepreneurship challenges
- **Leadership Under Pressure**: Experience making critical decisions with incomplete information
- **Mission-First Mentality**: Understanding of subordinating personal interests to larger objectives

### How Tim Likely Feels About Current Market (Late 2024/Early 2025)

**AI/SaaS Fatigue**: "Every founder pitches AI - most don't understand the operational complexity needed for real AI deployment. Veterans understand that technology without operational discipline fails."

**Veteran Founder Advantage**: "Military founders have built-in advantages in this market - discipline, systematic thinking, resilience. But too many civilian investors don't recognize these qualities or know how to evaluate them."

**Market Timing for Veterans**: "This is actually the perfect time for veteran founders. AI tools level the playing field for small teams, and military operational excellence becomes a competitive advantage."

**Fundraising Environment**: "Good veteran founders with real traction can still raise, but it requires more discipline and better storytelling than 2021. Military founders should lean into their operational advantages."

**AI Productivity Skepticism**: "Most productivity tools are solving the wrong problems. They automate easy tasks instead of addressing core operational challenges. Military founders understand the difference between efficiency and effectiveness."

**Subject**: West Point → YC → AI Productivity: Building the Operating System for Entrepreneurs

Hi Tim,

I came across Context Ventures through your military veteran startup work and your thesis about bringing military-grade operational discipline to business resonated deeply.

Like you, I went from military service to tech, but via the YC route. Spent my post-service years at Curri (YC S19) as a software engineer building integration systems that connected drivers to Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash - work that helped increase their delivery margins significantly.

That experience taught me that most entrepreneurs fail not from bad ideas, but from poor execution and lack of systems. So I'm building BuildOS - an AI-native productivity platform that brings the operational excellence we learned in the military to ambitious entrepreneurs.

Early traction has been encouraging, and I'd love to get your perspective on what we're building. Not necessarily seeking investment right now, but would value insights from someone who understands both the military mindset and the startup ecosystem.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about the intersection of military thinking and entrepreneurial success?

Best,
[Name]

P.S. - I see you're hosting the Military Veteran Startup Conference in February. This feels like exactly the kind of community I'd love to connect with.

## Key Positioning Points

### Why This Approach Works

- **Military Connection**: Instant credibility and shared experience
- **Systematic Operations**: Curri integration work demonstrates operational excellence
- **Veteran Entrepreneur Focus**: Perfect alignment with Context Ventures thesis
- **Non-pushy**: Seeking advice, not immediately asking for money

### Follow-Up Strategy

1. **Week 1**: Send initial email
2. **Week 2**: If no response, mention specific military veteran startup conference interest
3. **Week 3**: Share BuildOS user testimonial from another veteran entrepreneur
4. **Month 1**: Update on traction with military/veteran user base

### Preparation Before Sending

- [ ] Research Context Ventures recent portfolio companies
- [ ] Prepare 3-5 examples of military operational thinking applied to BuildOS
- [ ] Have specific Curri integration metrics ready (delivery volume, margin improvement)
- [ ] Research attendees/speakers at upcoming Military Veteran Startup Conference

### Expected Response Rate

**High (70-80%)** - Military connection, veteran founder focus, and non-immediate investment ask create strong incentives to respond.
