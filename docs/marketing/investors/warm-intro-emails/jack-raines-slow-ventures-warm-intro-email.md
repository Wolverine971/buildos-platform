# Jack Raines (Slow Ventures) - Warm Introduction Email Template

## Investor Context

- **Fund**: Slow Ventures (Generalist + $63M Creator Fund)
- **Background**: Columbia MBA → Content Creator (70k Twitter) → VC
- **Investment Thesis**: "Moderately unhinged founders," passionate builders, creator economy
- **Connection Strength**: 75% - YC alignment + authentic founder story fit

### Specific Common Ground Opportunities

- **Non-Traditional Path**: Military service vs. his content creator background - both unconventional routes to entrepreneurship
- **Authentic Storytelling**: Military experiences provide authentic narrative, his content creation values genuine stories
- **Anti-Corporate Culture**: Military skepticism of bureaucracy, his anti-corporate hustle culture stance
- **YC Ecosystem**: Both connected to YC network and understand startup acceleration
- **Content Creation Potential**: Military founder story could be compelling content for his audience
- **Behavioral Finance Interest**: Military decision-making under uncertainty, his behavioral finance focus
- **Direct Communication**: Military straight-talk culture, his preference for authentic over polished communication
- **Building vs. Talking**: Military action orientation, his focus on founders who actually build

### How Jack Likely Feels About Current Market (Late 2024/Early 2025)

**Founder Authenticity Shortage**: "Too many founders are optimizing for investor-friendly narratives instead of building real businesses. Military founders are refreshing - they have authentic grit stories and understand that execution matters more than storytelling."

**AI Founder Fatigue**: "Everyone's a AI founder now, but most are just riding the hype wave. Military + YC backgrounds suggest you were building systematically before AI became trendy. That's the kind of authentic obsession I'm looking for."

**Creator Economy Integration**: "The best startups now have founder-led growth strategies. Military founders who understand systematic approaches could be great at building authentic audiences. Your story could resonate with other veteran entrepreneurs."

**Market Timing Advantage**: "This correction separates passionate builders from opportunistic founders. Military training in adversity is perfect for this environment. VCs are looking for founders who can execute when conditions aren't perfect."

**Young Money Audience Appeal**: "My audience loves authentic founder stories, especially unconventional backgrounds. Military → YC → AI productivity could be compelling content and help with organic growth marketing."

**Slow Ventures Deployment**: "We're actively deploying from recent fundraising. Looking for passionate, slightly unhinged founders building meaningful businesses. Military discipline + YC speed + AI vision could be the perfect combination."
