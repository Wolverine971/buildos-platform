# Sarah Guo (Conviction) - Warm Introduction Email Template

## Investor Context

- **Fund**: Conviction ($100M+ fund, Software 3.0 thesis)
- **Background**: Former Greylock GP, "No Priors" podcast host
- **Investment Thesis**: AI-native companies manipulating foundation models
- **Connection Strength**: 85% - Perfect Software 3.0 + technical founder alignment

### Specific Common Ground Opportunities

- **Technical Depth**: Both appreciate engineering complexity and technical architecture
- **Contrarian Thinking**: Military training in questioning assumptions, her contrarian investment approach
- **First-Principles Reasoning**: Military operational planning and her Software 3.0 framework
- **Building vs. Talking**: Both value execution over theory and proven technical implementation
- **AI Skepticism**: Military training in questioning technology capabilities vs. marketing claims
- **Systems Thinking**: Understanding complex interactions and emergent behaviors
- **Continuous Learning**: Military professional development and her "No Priors" exploration mindset
- **Performance Under Pressure**: High-stakes decision making in both military and VC contexts

### How Sarah Likely Feels About Current Market (Late 2024/Early 2025)

**AI Wrapper Fatigue**: "I'm exhausted by founders who think calling OpenAI APIs makes them AI-native. Real Software 3.0 companies manipulate foundation models and couldn't exist in the previous era. Most productivity tools are just ChatGPT wrappers with nice UIs."

**Technical Founder Appreciation**: "The best founders right now combine deep technical understanding with domain expertise. Military + engineering backgrounds are perfect - you understand both the systematic requirements and the technical implementation challenges."

**Harvey Success Validation**: "Harvey proves that AI-native approaches can transform traditional industries. But productivity is harder - everyone thinks they understand productivity, but most tools solve the wrong problems. Need founders who understand the difference."

**Market Timing Anxiety**: "We're in the early innings of Software 3.0, but the window for building truly differentiated AI-native companies is narrow. Foundation model capabilities are advancing fast, but so is competition. Need to move quickly with real technical differentiation."

**Founder-Market Fit Obsession**: "In this environment, founder-market fit is everything. Can't just be technically competent - need to deeply understand the problem domain. Military operational experience + YC startup execution could be the perfect combination for productivity transformation."

**Defensive About AI Skepticism**: "Everyone's become an AI skeptic because of all the wrapper companies. But the real opportunities are massive. Just need founders who understand the difference between leveraging AI and building AI-native architectures."

**Subject**: Software 3.0 for Productivity: AI-Native Platform by YC Alum

Hi Sarah,

Your "Software 3.0" thesis perfectly captures what we're building at BuildOS. Like Harvey transforming legal work, we're reimagining productivity from first principles using AI.

My background gives me a unique perspective: military training in systematic operations, then 3 years at Curri (YC S19) building integration systems that connected to Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash APIs. This taught me that most productivity tools fail because they're built for perfect workflows, not the chaotic reality of how founders actually work.

BuildOS manipulates foundation models to understand natural work patterns and automatically creates structured workflows - true Software 3.0, not AI features bolted onto legacy productivity tools.

I've been following your Harvey investment thesis and would love to share how we're applying similar principles to the productivity space. Not looking for investment immediately, but would value your perspective on AI-native approaches to traditional software categories.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about transforming productivity with AI?

Best,
[Name]

- **Founder-Market Fit**: Unique combination of systematic thinking + technical execution

### Harvey Investment Parallels

**Domain Expertise**: ✅ Military operational systems + YC startup experience
**Technical Co-founder**: ✅ Proven engineering at scale (Curri integrations)
**Industry Transformation**: ✅ Reimagining productivity workflows with AI
**Customer Traction**: ✅ Evidence of users finding genuine value

### Follow-Up Strategy

1. **Week 1**: Send initial email
2. **Week 2**: If no response, share specific technical architecture insight
3. **Week 3**: Reference recent "No Priors" episode relevant to productivity
4. **Month 1**: Share BuildOS user case study paralleling Harvey's approach

### Preparation Before Sending

- [ ] Listen to recent "No Priors" episodes for current thinking
- [ ] Prepare technical architecture comparison to Harvey's approach
