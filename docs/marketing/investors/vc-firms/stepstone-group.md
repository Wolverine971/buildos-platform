## Portfolio Companies

### From LinkedIn Post:

| Company    | Sector         | Status                             |
| ---------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Chewy      | E-commerce     | Pet products, public company       |
| Anduril    | Defense Tech   | $30.5B valuation (2025)            |
| SpaceX     | Space          | Leading private space company      |
| Cloudflare | Infrastructure | Public company, web infrastructure |

### Investment Activity (2024-2025):

- **28 funding rounds** in last 12 months
- **1 acquisition** in last 12 months
- **81 companies** in direct portfolio
- **1,000+ companies** through fund-of-funds

### Note on Portfolio:

StepStone's portfolio exposure comes through multiple channels:

- Secondary purchases
- LP positions in VC funds
- Co-investments

The Anduril, SpaceX, Chewy, and Cloudflare exposure may be through secondaries or LP positions rather than direct primary investments.

## Why StepStone Group Is NOT Right for BuildOS (Current Stage)

### Fundamental Mismatch:

1. **Institutional Scale**: $771B total capital, $209B AUM - too large for seed stage
2. **Secondaries Focus**: Largest VC secondaries fund, not primary early-stage
3. **Fund-of-Funds**: Multi-manager approach, invests in VC funds not directly
4. **Diversification Model**: 1,000+ companies through funds
5. **Public Company**: Different risk/return profile than early-stage VC

### What They Actually Do:

- Invest in other VC funds (LP positions)
- Buy secondary stakes in later-stage companies
- Co-invest alongside established VC firms
- Provide diversified private markets exposure to institutions

### Check Size Mismatch:

StepStone's minimum investment would likely be far larger than appropriate for BuildOS's current stage. Their diversification model suggests they don't focus on individual early-stage startups.

## Approach Strategy

### Not Appropriate for Current Fundraising:

StepStone is fundamentally different from a typical VC firm:

1. **Wrong Structure**: Fund-of-funds and secondaries, not primary seed
2. **Wrong Scale**: Institutional investor, not startup investor
3. **Wrong Entry Point**: Secondary market, not primary rounds
4. **Wrong Relationship**: Invest in funds, not directly in early companies

### Future Relevance:

StepStone could become relevant for BuildOS in specific scenarios:

1. **Secondary Transaction**: If existing investors want liquidity
2. **LP in Future Funds**: If BuildOS's investors have StepStone as LP
3. **Growth Stage Co-Investment**: At Series C+ alongside lead VC

## Summary Score: 🔴 **Not a Target - Wrong Type of Investor**

StepStone Group is a global institutional private markets firm, not a typical VC that invests directly in early-stage startups. Their $771B scale, secondaries focus, and fund-of-funds model make them inappropriate for BuildOS's current fundraising needs.

**Success Probability**: N/A (wrong investor type)
**Strategic Value**: None for seed/early-stage fundraising
**Best Approach**: Do not pursue for direct investment

**Recommendation**: Remove from investor target list. StepStone operates at institutional scale through funds-of-funds and secondaries. They don't make direct seed investments in individual startups.

**Future Relevance**: Could matter if:

- BuildOS investors want secondary liquidity
- BuildOS reaches Series C+ and StepStone co-invests
- StepStone is LP in a fund that invests in BuildOS
