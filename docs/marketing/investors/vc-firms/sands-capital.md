## Why Sands Capital Could Be Strategic for BuildOS

### Potential Alignment:

1. **DC Location**: Arlington, VA headquarters - deep government network
2. **AI/Cyber Focus**: Chris Eng specializes in AI and cybersecurity
3. **Defense Tech**: Anduril investment shows defense market interest
4. **Long-Term Orientation**: Patient capital approach
5. **Global Scale**: $56B AUM provides significant resources

### Significant Concerns:

- **Stage Mismatch**: Mid-stage and growth-stage focus, not early-stage
- **Check Size**: Likely much larger than early-stage rounds ($10M+)
- **Growth Metrics Required**: Probably need significant revenue/traction
- **Public Equity Component**: Integrated platform includes public markets

## Approach Strategy

### For Future Rounds (Series B+):

Sands Capital is better positioned as a future investor for BuildOS:

1. **Series B Target**: When BuildOS has growth-stage metrics
2. **AI/Cyber Angle**: Position through Chris Eng's focus areas
3. **Defense Market**: If BuildOS develops government/defense customer base
4. **DC Advantage**: Local investor with government network

### Current Stage (Too Early):

- BuildOS likely too early for Sands Capital's typical investment
- Growth equity requires established metrics and revenue
- Consider for Series B or later

### If Building Relationship Now:

1. Introduce through DC tech community
2. Keep Chris Eng informed of progress
3. Target for future round when metrics align
4. Position BuildOS for growth-stage opportunity

### Warm Introduction Paths:

1. **DC Tech Community**: Arlington/Northern Virginia ecosystem
2. **Cybersecurity Networks**: Through Chris Eng's security focus
3. **Anduril Connections**: Defense tech community
4. **Fintech Networks**: Ramp and other fintech investments

## Investment Terms (Estimated)

- **Check Size**: $10M-$50M+ (growth equity)
- **Stage**: Mid-stage, Growth-stage (Series B+)
- **Ownership Target**: Meaningful minority positions
- **Time Horizon**: Long-term (5-10+ years)

## Summary Score: 🟡 **Future Target - Too Early Now**

Sands Capital represents an excellent future investor for BuildOS given their DC location, AI/cyber focus, and defense tech track record. However, their growth-stage focus makes them inappropriate for current seed/early-stage fundraising.

**Current Fit**: Not aligned (too early)
**Future Fit**: Strong (Series B+)
**Strategic Value**: Very High when ready (DC network, defense credibility, AI expertise)

**Recommendation**: Do not pursue for current round. Add to Series B target list. Consider building relationship now through:

1. DC tech community events
2. Chris Eng's cybersecurity networks
3. Updates on progress and growth metrics
4. Defense/government customer development

**Timing**: Revisit when BuildOS has:

- $2M+ ARR
- Clear growth trajectory
- Enterprise/government customer traction
- Series B fundraising timeline
