## Summary Score: ðŸ”´ **Low Priority / Future Target**

Matrix Partners presents poor alignment for BuildOS given their strong B2B SaaS focus and enterprise expertise, while BuildOS is currently individual-focused. Their investment thesis and partner expertise (particularly David Skok) are specifically designed for business software companies, not consumer productivity tools.

**Success Probability**: Low (fundamental B2B vs B2C mismatch)
**Strategic Value**: Very High (if aligned in future B2B expansion)
**Timeline**: Not recommended for current seed round

**Recommendation**: Consider Matrix for Series A or later rounds when BuildOS has developed team collaboration features and enterprise customers. David Skok's SaaS expertise would be invaluable for B2B expansion, but Matrix is unlikely to invest in the current individual user stage.

**Future Opportunity**: Excellent target once BuildOS has established enterprise product-market fit and is scaling B2B revenue.
