### Email Approach:

```
Subject: AI-Native Productivity Platform - Zero to One Market Creation

Hi [Contact],

BuildOS represents a contrarian bet on the future of productivity software.
While incumbents add AI features to legacy architectures, we built an
AI-native platform from the ground up.

Our technical approach creates monopolistic advantages:
â€¢ Proprietary AI models that learn from user workflow patterns
â€¢ Network effects through cross-user intelligence and collaboration
â€¢ Enterprise moats via deep workflow integration and switching costs

Early enterprise validation shows 5x productivity improvements vs.
traditional tools, suggesting we're creating a new category rather
than competing in an existing one.

Given Founders Fund's contrarian approach and AI investment thesis,
would love to share our Zero to One strategy for productivity software.

Best,
[Founder Name]
```
