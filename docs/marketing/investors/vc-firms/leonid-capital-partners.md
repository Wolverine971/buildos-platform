# Leonid Capital Partners - BuildOS Investor Profile

**Last Updated**: February 2026
**Source**: DC-Based Elite VCs List (LinkedIn)

## Fund Overview

- **Type**: Private Credit (NOT Equity VC)
- **Founded**: 2019
- **Fund I**: $240M+ (oversubscribed, Oct 2023)
- **Evergreen Fund**: $265M+ raised (exceeded 2024 goals)
- **Focus**: Government contractors and national security tech
- **Structure**: Credit facility/debt financing

## Investment Thesis

**"Private Credit for Government Contractors"**

Leonid Capital Partners delivers private credit solutions for national security tech and government contractors. They are a specialized credit provider for businesses contracting with the federal government for highly technical engagements in software, biotech, and engineering. As an official Department of Defense Trusted Capital Provider, they offer advance financing on all government contracts, including SBIR and STTRs.

### Key Differentiator:

This is **debt financing**, not equity investment. They provide working capital and credit facilities, not venture capital in the traditional sense.

## Key Team

### James Parker - Co-Founder

- "Our increasing deal size and an expanding list of borrowers are excellent metrics for a private credit investment manager"

### Samuel MacGregor - SkillBridge Deal Team Partner

## Why Leonid Capital Is NOT Right for BuildOS

### Fundamental Mismatch:

1. **Debt, Not Equity**: Leonid provides credit facilities and loans, not venture capital
2. **Government Contractor Focus**: Requires existing government contracts
3. **Revenue Requirement**: Finances companies with government revenue
4. **Not Startup Stage**: Designed for established contractors, not early-stage startups
5. **Wrong Capital Type**: BuildOS needs equity investment, not debt financing

### What They Actually Do:

- Advance financing on government contracts
- Working capital for SBIR/STTR recipients
- Credit facilities for defense contractors
- Acquisition financing for government services companies

## When Leonid WOULD Be Relevant:

Leonid could be relevant for BuildOS in the future if:

1. BuildOS wins government contracts (SBIR, STTR, defense procurement)
2. BuildOS needs working capital to fulfill government orders
3. BuildOS acquires a government contracting business
4. BuildOS has significant government revenue to finance

## Summary Score: 🔴 **Not a Target - Wrong Capital Type**

Leonid Capital Partners provides private credit (debt financing) for government contractors, not equity venture capital for startups. This is fundamentally the wrong type of capital for BuildOS's current needs.

**Success Probability**: N/A (wrong capital type)
**Strategic Value**: Future potential if BuildOS wins government contracts
**Best Approach**: Do not pursue for current fundraising

**Recommendation**: Remove from investor target list. However, bookmark for future reference if BuildOS:

- Wins SBIR/STTR grants that need financing
- Develops significant government contractor revenue
- Needs working capital for government contract fulfillment

**Alternative Value**: Leonid's existence signals that the government contractor financing market is active, which could inform BuildOS's government market entry strategy.
