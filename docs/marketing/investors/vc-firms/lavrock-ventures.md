## Investment Thesis

**"Enterprise Software, Cybersecurity, and National Security"**

Lavrock Ventures focuses on B2B technology companies, particularly in enterprise software, data, deep tech, and national security sectors. They invest in founders solving critical problems at the intersection of software, deep tech, and national security. Based right outside Washington, D.C., they are enterprise technology investors first and foremost.

### Dual-Use Focus:

They invest in both commercial and national security markets because these markets are increasingly converging. Technologies that start in the defense sector often find commercial applications, and vice versa.

### Alex Poulin's Investment Philosophy (from June 2025 Interview):

> "Software enables speed, scalability, and rapid iteration essential for solving today's dynamic commercial and defense challenges, while deep tech—spanning fields like quantum, autonomy, and next-gen hardware—drives foundational shifts in capability and competitiveness."

> "We're on the ground in DC and we've been doing this for years – we know investing here takes patience, nuance, and real connections."

> "Successful deep tech founders need to speak two languages fluently: the technical language as well as the customer language."

### What They Look For:

- Founders who can "speak two languages" - technical AND customer
- Companies that can scale across commercial AND defense markets
- Hard, high-stakes problems with both strategic and economic value
