### Portfolio from LinkedIn Post:

The LinkedIn post mentioned Poolside and Synthesia, but research didn't confirm these as direct portfolio investments. Jake Poliskin has shared content about Synthesia's CEO, but this appears to be industry commentary rather than investment.

## Why Shorewind Capital Could Be Strategic for BuildOS

### Potential Concerns:

1. **Sector Mismatch**: Primary focus on health and climate tech
2. **Small Portfolio**: Only 8-10 investments total
3. **Science/Deep Tech Preference**: "Science and tech to catalyze sea changes"
4. **Not DC-Based**: Actually based in Burlingame, CA (Bay Area)
5. **Limited AI/Software Focus**: Portfolio weighted toward biotech/climate

### Limited Alignment:

- Jake Poliskin has AI interest (per LinkedIn profile)
- "Frontier tech within other verticals" leaves some flexibility
- But primary thesis doesn't match productivity software

## Approach Strategy

### Not Recommended:

Shorewind Capital's thesis is fundamentally focused on health and climate deep tech, which doesn't align with BuildOS's productivity software focus:

1. **Wrong Sector**: Health/climate vs. productivity software
2. **Wrong Technology**: Science/deep tech vs. AI software
3. **Small Fund**: Limited portfolio suggests focused thesis
4. **Limited Fit**: "Frontier tech" typically means hard science

### If Pursuing Anyway:

- Position BuildOS as "frontier productivity technology"
- Emphasize AI-native architecture as technological innovation
- Highlight any health/wellness angles (ADHD management)

- **Jake Poliskin LinkedIn**: [linkedin.com/in/jacobpoliskin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobpoliskin/)

## Investment Terms

- **Check Size**: Seed/Series A stage appropriate
- **Stage**: Seed, Series A
- **Sector Preference**: Health, Climate, Frontier Tech

## Summary Score: 🔴 **Low Priority - Thesis Mismatch**

Shorewind Capital's focused thesis on health and climate frontier technology doesn't align with BuildOS's productivity software focus. Despite being listed in the DC VCs post, they're actually Bay Area-based with a specialized deep tech focus.

**Success Probability**: Very Low (thesis mismatch)
**Strategic Value**: Low (no productivity/enterprise focus)
**Best Approach**: Do not pursue

**Recommendation**: Remove from target list. Their health/climate deep tech focus and small, specialized portfolio suggest no fit for BuildOS. The LinkedIn post may have included them based on DC connections rather than thesis alignment.
