# Point Nine Capital - VC Firm Profile

## Fund Overview

- **Fund Size**: Fund VI (latest) - â‚¬0.5-5M initial checks
- **Founded**: 2011 (strong SaaS track record)
- **Geographic Focus**: Europe-focused, 20-30% investments in US/Canada
- **Check Size**: â‚¬0.5-3M initial (seed stage), occasional "Seed II" or early Series A
- **Investment Stages**: Primarily seed (v0.9 stage), some pre-seed and early Series A

## Investment Thesis

**"B2B SaaS and B2B marketplaces at the v0.9 stage"**

Point Nine Capital focuses exclusively on B2B software companies that have achieved initial product-market fit but need capital to scale. They're particularly strong at evaluating SaaS metrics and have extensive experience with productivity and workflow tools. **Note: This creates a potential misalignment with BuildOS's current B2C individual user focus.**

## Key Partners & Backgrounds

- **Christoph Janz** - Founder & Managing Partner, renowned SaaS expert and blogger
- **Team of 16** with 8 partners across Germany and US offices
- **Former operators** with deep SaaS scaling experience
- **Strong networks** in European and US SaaS ecosystems

## Track Record & Portfolio Success

### Exceptional Performance:

- **10 unicorns** from portfolio
- **4 IPOs** including major successes
- **43 acquisitions** with strong exit multiples
- **>65%** of seed companies successfully raise Series A
- **10+ companies** at $100M+ ARR

### Notable Portfolio Companies:

- **Zendesk** (IPO) - Customer service platform
- **Loom** (Acquired by Atlassian for $975M) - Video messaging platform
- **Contentful** ($489M raised) - Content management platform
- **Delivery Hero** (IPO) - Food delivery marketplace
- **Algolia** ($334M raised) - Search and discovery API

### Portfolio Relevance to BuildOS:

âœ… **Perfect fit** - Multiple productivity and workflow SaaS tools
âœ… **B2B expertise** - Deep understanding of business software scaling
âœ… **SaaS metrics focus** - Extensive experience with SaaS unit economics
âœ… **International reach** - Strong for global expansion strategy

## Alignment Assessment for BuildOS

### Potential Strategic Challenges:

1. **B2B Focus Mismatch**: Exclusive focus on B2B SaaS conflicts with BuildOS's current B2C positioning
2. **Enterprise Customer Requirement**: Portfolio companies typically serve business customers, not individuals
3. **Different Metrics Framework**: B2B SaaS metrics may not directly apply to individual subscription model
4. **Stage Definition Gap**: "v0.9" stage typically refers to B2B product-market fit, not consumer PMF

### Potential Future Alignment:

- **Long-term B2B Evolution**: Point Nine could be relevant when BuildOS expands to team/enterprise features
- **SaaS Metrics Expertise**: Christoph Janz's framework could apply once BuildOS has team subscriptions
- **European Expansion**: Strong networks for international market development
- **Productivity Tool Experience**: Portfolio relevance once BuildOS serves business users

## Point Nine's "SaaS Metrics 2.0" Focus

### Key Metrics They Evaluate:

1. **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** growth rate
2. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** and payback period
3. **Lifetime Value (LTV)** and LTV/CAC ratio
4. **Net Revenue Retention (NRR)** and expansion revenue
5. **Churn rates** (both customer and revenue churn)
6. **Sales efficiency** metrics and unit economics

Subject: AI-Powered Productivity SaaS - Strong Unit Economics

Hi Christoph,

BuildOS is a B2B productivity platform with AI-powered project organization.
We're at the "v0.9" stage with strong early metrics:

â€¢ $XXK MRR growing X% month-over-month
â€¢ XX% trial-to-paid conversion rate
â€¢ <X% monthly churn with XX% net revenue retention

Our AI features are driving 40%+ higher engagement vs. traditional project
management tools, with users reporting significant productivity improvements.

Would love to share our detailed metrics and discuss how BuildOS fits Point
Nine's B2B SaaS investment thesis.

Best,
[Founder Name]

P.S. - Your SaaS metrics framework has been invaluable for our business planning.

## Summary Score: ðŸ”´ **Low Priority / Future Target**

Point Nine Capital presents poor alignment for BuildOS given their exclusive B2B SaaS focus while BuildOS is currently B2C individual-focused. Their investment thesis and portfolio experience are specifically designed for business software companies, not consumer productivity tools.

**Success Probability**: Low (fundamental B2B vs B2C mismatch)
**Strategic Value**: High (if aligned in future B2B expansion)
**Timeline**: Not recommended for current seed round

**Recommendation**: Consider Point Nine for Series A or later rounds when BuildOS has developed team collaboration features and enterprise customers. Their SaaS expertise would be invaluable for B2B expansion, but they're unlikely to invest in the current individual user stage.

**Future Opportunity**: Excellent target once BuildOS has transitioned to serving business customers with team/enterprise features.
