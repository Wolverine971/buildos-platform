## Why Columbia Capital Could Be Strategic for BuildOS

### Potential Alignment:

1. **Enterprise Technology Focus**: Invests in enterprise software and IT
2. **DC Location**: Strong local presence and government relationships
3. **Long Track Record**: 35+ years of experience
4. **Multi-Stage**: Invests across stages

### Significant Concerns:

- **Infrastructure Focus**: Heavy bias toward physical/digital infrastructure
- **Stage**: $680M fund likely targeting larger deals
- **Thesis Mismatch**: "Picks and shovels" infrastructure vs. productivity software
- **Investment Pace**: Only 1 new investment in last 12 months (slower deployment)

## Approach Strategy

### Potential Positioning:

If pursuing, position BuildOS as enterprise productivity infrastructure:

1. **"Infrastructure for Knowledge Work"**: Frame as foundational productivity layer
2. **Enterprise Focus**: Emphasize B2B expansion roadmap
3. **Digital Infrastructure Parallel**: AI-native productivity as new infrastructure category

### What to Avoid:

- Consumer/ADHD positioning without enterprise angle
- Ignoring their infrastructure-first investment thesis
- Not addressing fit with "picks and shovels" approach

### Warm Introduction Paths:

1. **DC Tech Community**: Northern Virginia tech ecosystem
2. **Enterprise Technology Network**: Through portfolio company founders
3. **Government/Defense Contractors**: DC-based government tech community

## Investment Terms

- **Typical Check Size**: Varies by stage (Fund VII is $680M)
- **Board Involvement**: Typically takes board seats
- **Geographic Focus**: North America, Western Europe
- **Preferred Sectors**: Digital infrastructure, enterprise tech, mobility

## Summary Score: 🟡 **Medium-Low Priority**

Columbia Capital's "picks and shovels" infrastructure thesis doesn't naturally align with BuildOS's productivity software focus. While they invest in enterprise technology, their preference for digital infrastructure (data centers, fiber, towers) suggests limited interest in pure software plays.

**Success Probability**: Low-Medium (thesis mismatch)
**Strategic Value**: Medium (DC network, enterprise experience)
**Best Approach**: Only pursue if developing strong enterprise/infrastructure positioning

**Recommendation**: Lower priority target. Consider if BuildOS develops enterprise infrastructure positioning or needs DC-specific connections. Their slower investment pace and infrastructure focus suggest limited fit.
