## Why The New Industrial Corporation Is NOT Right for BuildOS

### Fundamental Mismatch:

1. **Infrastructure Capital**: Not traditional venture capital
2. **Physical/Industrial Focus**: Manufacturing, batteries, weather tech
3. **Project Development**: Involves building physical projects, not software
4. **Reindustrialization**: Focus on rebuilding American manufacturing
5. **Different Capital Type**: Venture + infrastructure hybrid

### What They Actually Do:

- Project development for industrial assets
- Infrastructure capital deployment
- Manufacturing and physical technology investments
- Reindustrialization initiatives
- Legacy market transformation

### Not Software-Focused:

The portfolio (Atomic Industries, Verkor, Rainmaker) consists of physical/industrial companies, not software or productivity tools. This is fundamentally a different investment category.

## Approach Strategy

### Not Recommended:

The New Industrial Corporation's focus on reindustrialization and infrastructure capital doesn't align with BuildOS:

1. **Wrong Capital Type**: Infrastructure + venture hybrid
2. **Wrong Sector**: Manufacturing, batteries, physical tech
3. **Wrong Model**: Project development, not startup investment
4. **Wrong Scale**: Infrastructure-scale investments

### Alternative Connection:

Austin Bishop's role at Tamarack Global (AI, energy, aerospace, national security) could be a separate avenue to explore if BuildOS develops defense/aerospace applications.

## Summary Score: 🔴 **Not a Target - Wrong Capital Type**

The New Industrial Corporation focuses on infrastructure capital and project development for reindustrialization, not venture capital for software startups. This is fundamentally the wrong type of investor for BuildOS.

**Success Probability**: Very Low (wrong capital type and sector)
**Strategic Value**: None for productivity software
**Best Approach**: Do not pursue

**Recommendation**: Remove from investor target list. Their focus on physical infrastructure, manufacturing, and project development doesn't translate to software investment.

**Alternative**: If interested in Austin Bishop's network, explore:

- Tamarack Global (AI, aerospace, national security venture fund)
- Defense/industrial productivity applications
- Reindustrialization community for enterprise customer leads
