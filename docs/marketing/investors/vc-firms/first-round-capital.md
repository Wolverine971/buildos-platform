Subject: AI-Native Productivity Platform - Reimagining Personal Organization

Hi [Partner Name],

BuildOS is reimagining personal productivity through AI-native architecture.
Instead of adding AI features to traditional project management, we built a
platform where AI fundamentally powers how users capture, organize, and
execute on their work.

Early users report 40%+ productivity improvements and describe BuildOS as
"life-changing" for how they approach daily work organization. We see this
as the next evolution beyond tools like Notion toward truly intelligent
productivity platforms.

Given First Round's investment in Notion and focus on revolutionary
productivity tools, would love to share our vision and early traction.

Best,
[Founder Name]
```
