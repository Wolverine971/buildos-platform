### Portfolio Characteristics:

- Focus on aerospace and defense technology
- Early-stage (pre-seed through Series A)

## Why New Vista Capital Could Be Strategic for BuildOS

### Potential Alignment:

1. **Veteran Founders**: Team includes Gen. Wilson - military culture
2. **DC Location**: Washington, DC headquarters
3. **Right Stage**: Pre-seed, Seed, Series A
4. **Right Check Size**: $1M-$3M matches typical rounds
5. **AI Interest**: Looking at "AI across the board"

### Significant Concerns:

- **Aerospace/Defense Specific**: Thesis is explicitly A&D focused
- **Pentagon Technology**: Looking for tech DoD "actually needs"
- **Physical/Hardware Bias**: Satellites, hypersonics, sea gliders
- **Sector Mismatch**: Productivity software not in thesis

### Thesis Specificity:

Kirsten Bartok Touw explicitly mentioned:

- "Really urgent needs" for the Pentagon
- Space-based capabilities
- Hypersonics and Golden Dome tech
- AI applications "of interest to the Pentagon"

This is highly specific to defense applications, not general productivity.

## Approach Strategy

### If Pursuing (Low Probability of Success):

1. **Pentagon Workforce Productivity**: Frame BuildOS for defense worker productivity
2. **AI for DoD**: Position as AI-native tool for government workforce
3. **Veteran Connection**: Lead with Anna's USMC background
4. **Government Expansion**: Show clear path to federal customer base

### What to Avoid:

- Consumer/ADHD positioning
- General productivity without defense application
- Ignoring their explicit A&D thesis

### Realistic Assessment:

New Vista's thesis is explicitly aerospace and defense technology for Pentagon needs. Productivity software, even for defense workers, is likely outside their investment scope unless there's a clear defense technology component.

## Investment Terms

- **Check Size**: $1M-$3M
- **Stage**: Pre-seed, Seed, Series A
- **Sector**: Aerospace and Defense
- **LP Base**: Industry executives, generals, high net worth individuals, family offices

## Summary Score: 🔴 **Low Priority - Thesis Mismatch**

New Vista Capital's explicit focus on aerospace and defense technology for Pentagon needs doesn't align with BuildOS's productivity software focus. While they have impressive defense credentials and the right stage/check size, their thesis is too specialized for general productivity software.

**Success Probability**: Very Low (explicit A&D thesis)
**Strategic Value**: Low (unless pivoting to defense tech)
**Stage/Check Match**: Good, but thesis mismatch

**Recommendation**: Deprioritize unless BuildOS develops explicit defense technology applications or Pentagon workforce use cases. The team's credentials are impressive, but thesis alignment is critical.

**Alternative Value**: Could be valuable for:

- Understanding defense market needs
- Introductions to defense industry
- Advisory on government market entry
