## Summary Score: 🟡 **High Priority IF Diversity Aligned**

SLAUSON & Co. represents an exceptional investor for BuildOS **IF there is authentic alignment on the diversity and economic inclusion mission**. The firm's focus on underrepresented founders, SMB tech, and growing AI interest creates strong strategic fit, but only if BuildOS founders have backgrounds and market positioning that align with SLAUSON & Co.'s core thesis.

**Success Probability**: Medium-High (depends entirely on diversity alignment and founder backgrounds)
**Strategic Value**: Exceptional (community access, LA ecosystem, diverse networks, brand building)
**Timeline**: 4-8 weeks (Friends & Family) or 6-10 weeks (Fund II)

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Authentic Diversity Alignment**: BuildOS founders must authentically align with economic inclusion mission
2. **Underserved Market Focus**: Clear positioning on serving underrepresented communities or SMBs
3. **Lived Experience Advantage**: Compelling story about unique founder perspective

- Apply to Friends & Family for $300K + community support (earlier stage)
- Or pursue Fund II for $500K-$2M lead investment (later stage)

**If BuildOS founders do not align with diversity thesis:**

- 🔴 **Low Priority** - Firm's core mission is economic inclusion for underrepresented founders
- Would be misalignment to pursue without authentic diversity fit
- Consider other investors better aligned with founder backgrounds

### Key Decision Question

**"Do BuildOS founders have backgrounds, experiences, or market focus that authentically align with SLAUSON & Co.'s mission of economic inclusion and supporting underrepresented entrepreneurs?"**
