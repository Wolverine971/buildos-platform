## How to Approach Ali Abdaal

### Optimal Positioning for BuildOS

**Hook/Opening Line**:

> "As someone who teaches evidence-based productivity to millions, I built BuildOS to solve a problem I see in your audience: people know HOW to be productive, but they lack a SYSTEM to organize their actual work. BuildOS is that missing system."

**Alternative Hook**:

> "I watch your videos on Notion systems and productivity frameworks—BuildOS is essentially those frameworks, but AI-powered and designed for execution, not just organization."

**Key Positioning Elements**:

1. **Problem Frame**:
    - "Your audience loves productivity systems, but most tools are blank canvases (Notion) or rigid templates (Asana). There's a gap: people need guided structure that adapts to their brain."
    - "The problem isn't lack of tools—it's lack of an integrated system that turns messy thoughts into clear action plans."

2. **Solution Position**:
    - "BuildOS is the evidence-based productivity system you teach, built into software. It's cognitive scaffolding for knowledge work."
    - "Think: Notion for structure + AI for thinking + GTD for execution = BuildOS"

3. **Traction/Proof Points**:
    - User testimonials from students/knowledge workers
    - Time-to-clarity metrics: "Users go from brain dump to action plan in 10 minutes"
    - Retention: Show daily active usage
    - User outcomes: Stress reduction, project completion rates

4. **Vision/Opportunity**:
    - "Every knowledge worker needs a thinking partner. Right now they're using disconnected tools. BuildOS integrates it all."
    - "We're building the personal operating system for the 2B+ knowledge workers globally. Starting with students and entrepreneurs—your audience."

5. **Personal Connection**:
    - "I built this inspired by your Notion systems videos—but realized most people can't build those systems themselves. They need AI to do the scaffolding."
    - "This is the tool you'd recommend after teaching people GTD and Notion—it brings it all together"

### Outreach Strategy

**Best Channels**:

1. **Email to business/team** - Most professional for partnership/investment inquiries
    - Email likely goes through assistant/team
    - Include clear subject line and executive summary
    - Attach materials (deck, product demo video)

2. **Twitter/LinkedIn DM** - For initial quick intro
    - Keep it very short (2-3 sentences)
    - Lead with audience fit
    - "Built for your audience—would love feedback"

3. **YouTube comments / Community engagement** - Build familiarity first
    - Thoughtful comments on his videos
    - Share how you've implemented his advice
    - Warm up the relationship before direct ask

**Warm Intro Paths** (if available):

- **Thomas Frank** (fellow productivity YouTuber) - If any connection
- **Notion team** - He's a Notion ambassador/partner
- **Ali's team members** - If you can identify and connect with his team
- **PTYA students** - Alumni of his course who might know him

**Cold Outreach Template** (Email):

```
Subject: Partnership inquiry - BuildOS (AI productivity OS for your audience)

Hi Ali,

I'm [Name], founder of BuildOS—an AI-powered productivity system built for knowledge workers and students. I've been watching your Notion systems videos for years, and realized most people can't build those systems themselves. BuildOS does it for them.

Why I think your audience would love this:
✅ Turns brain dumps into structured project plans (what you teach, but automated)
✅ Built for students, knowledge workers, entrepreneurs (your core audience)
✅ Evidence-based: We've tested with [X users], [Y% report reduced overwhelm]
✅ Early users say "this is like having Ali's Notion system but it builds itself"

Traction: [X users], [Y MoM growth], [Z retention rate]

Would love to:
1. Get your feedback as a user
2. Explore partnership/investment opportunity
3. Potentially feature in future content if you find it valuable

I've built a 5-min demo video: [link]

Would 15-20 min for a call work?

Best,
[Name]

P.S. - I'm raising a $[X]M seed round and would love to have you as an angel investor if BuildOS aligns with your thesis.
```

### Pitch Approach

**Do's**:
✅ **Lead with user impact**: Show testimonials from students/knowledge workers about how BuildOS changed their productivity
✅ **Evidence-based framing**: If you have data on time savings, stress reduction, etc., lead with that
✅ **Connect to his content**: Reference specific videos or frameworks he's taught
✅ **Show, don't tell**: Demo the product extensively. He'll want to see and feel it.
✅ **Ask for feedback first**: "Would love your input as a user" before "will you invest?"
✅ **Long-term thinking**: Position as multi-year partnership, not just transactional investment
✅ **Mission alignment**: Emphasize the mission to help people flourish and reduce stress

**Don'ts**:
❌ **Pure hype**: Don't oversell without evidence. He's skeptical of marketing fluff.
❌ **Ignore his audience**: If you don't understand his audience (students, knowledge workers), he won't engage
❌ **Rush to the ask**: Build relationship first, investment conversation second
❌ **Overpromise**: Be honest about current state and roadmap
❌ **Forget the "why"**: He cares deeply about mission and impact, not just ROI

### Expected Timeline & Process

**Typical Investment Process**:

1. **Initial outreach** - Response within 1-2 weeks (if interested), may go to team first
2. **Product demo / trial** - He'll want to actually use the product (2-4 weeks)
3. **Team review** - Likely discusses with advisors/team (1-2 weeks)
4. **Decision** - Thoughtful, research-driven decision (2-4 weeks)
5. **Terms & close** - Standard angel terms, fairly straightforward (1-2 weeks)

**Total Expected Timeline**: 2-3 months from intro to close

**Decision-Making Style**:

- **Slow and thoughtful** (not impulsive)
- **User-experience driven**: Will actually use product extensively
- **Values-first**: Does this align with mission?
- **Research-based**: May ask for user data, testimonials, retention metrics

### Potential Objections & Responses

**Objection 1**: "How is this different from Notion + AI plugins?"
→ **Response**: "Notion is a blank canvas—users have to build the system. BuildOS is the system. We provide cognitive scaffolding, not just tools. It's the difference between giving someone Legos vs. giving them a blueprint + helping them build. For 90% of people, blank canvas = paralysis. We solve that."

**Objection 2**: "Will people actually change their habits to use this?"
→ **Response**: "Great question—that's why we designed BuildOS around existing behaviors. People already brain dump (notes apps, journals, voice memos). We just capture that natural process and structure it. Users don't have to change habits; we meet them where they are. Early data: [X%] of users are still active after 30 days because it fits their natural workflow."

**Objection 3**: "Why would students/young people pay for this?"
→ **Response**: "Same reason they pay for Notion Premium, Spotify, Netflix—if it's valuable, they'll pay. Our early users are students and junior professionals paying $[X]/mo because it saves them hours per week and reduces stress. That's worth way more than a few coffees per month. Plus, we'll have a freemium tier to get them hooked."

## Investment Likelihood Assessment

### Fit Score: 7.5/10

**Scoring Breakdown**:

- **Thesis Alignment**: 9/10 - Productivity tool for knowledge workers is perfect fit for his focus
- **Check Size Fit**: 7/10 - His typical $25-50K is good but smaller than some angels; investment history limited
- **Strategic Value**: 10/10 - His audience is 100% target market for BuildOS; huge amplification potential
- **Accessibility**: 6/10 - Team filters opportunities; less accessible than Twitter-native investors
- **Timing**: 7/10 - He's investing but slowly; timing less urgent than actively deploying fund managers

### Why He'd Be Interested in BuildOS

1. **Perfect Audience Alignment**: His 10M+ audience is exactly BuildOS's target market—productivity-focused knowledge workers and students

2. **Complements His Teaching**: BuildOS is essentially his Notion systems advice + AI, making it a natural fit for his content

3. **User Impact Focus**: His brand is built on helping people be more productive and less stressed—BuildOS's mission aligns perfectly

4. **Evidence-Based Approach**: If you can show data on user outcomes, that speaks his language

5. **Content Integration Opportunity**: He could feature BuildOS in videos, courses, newsletter—mutually beneficial partnership

### Recommended Ask

**Optimal Check Size to Request**: $25K - $50K

**Rationale**:

- Fits his typical angel investment range
- Meaningful but not so large it requires extensive diligence
- Room to negotiate up if he's very enthusiastic

**Alternative Ask** (if initial declined):

- **$10K + Strategic Advisory**: Smaller check but formalize his role as advisor/evangelist
- **Equity for promotion**: If he won't invest cash, offer equity for content featuring BuildOS (video, newsletter, course integration)
- **Free lifetime subscription**: Get him as a power user first, investment conversation later
