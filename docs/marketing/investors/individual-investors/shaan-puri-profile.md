## Investment Philosophy & Criteria

### Core Investment Thesis

Shaan's investment philosophy is refreshingly simple: **bet on great founders building simple businesses that solve real problems**. He's not interested in complex theses or chasing hot trends. Instead, he looks for businesses he can understand quickly, founders who can execute relentlessly, and problems that are obviously painful.

He's heavily influenced by the "copy-cat" approach—finding proven business models that are working elsewhere and betting on strong founders to execute similar plays in new markets or with new twists. He values speed, simplicity, and founder-market fit above fancy tech or complex moats.

**Key Principles**:

1. **Founder First**: The founder's drive, clarity, and speed matter more than the idea
2. **Simple > Complex**: Prefers businesses he can explain to his mom over sophisticated tech plays
3. **Proven Patterns**: Loves seeing proven business models executed by new founders
4. **Fast Feedback Loops**: Wants to see rapid iteration and customer feedback, not long R&D cycles
5. **Profitable > Growth**: Increasingly favors sustainable, profitable businesses over "growth at all costs"

### Investment Criteria

- Obsessive work ethic ("athletes" of business)
- Clear communication and thinking

✅ **Business Characteristics**:

- Simple business model (can explain in 1-2 sentences)
- Clear path to revenue (no "monetization TBD")

- Consumer-friendly with potential for word-of-mouth

✅ **Market Attributes**:

- Can reach customers without massive ad budgets

## Personality & Communication Style

### Enneagram Type (Estimated): Type 3 - The Achiever

**Why This Type**:

Shaan exhibits classic Type 3 characteristics:

- **Achievement-oriented**: Serial entrepreneur with multiple exits, constantly building
- **Image-conscious**: Curates strong personal brand, careful about public persona
- **Adaptable**: Successfully pivoted from live-streaming (Blab) to esports (Bebo) to crypto (Milk Road) to podcasting
- **Efficient**: Values speed and execution, dislikes waste
- **Success-driven**: Publicly tracks wins, talks about "making it," achievement-focused content
- **Competitive**: Fought to get into Lambda School deal, competed for Bebo acquisition

Type 3s are motivated by feeling valuable and worthwhile, and they achieve this through success and recognition. Shaan's podcast, Twitter presence, and public sharing of business wins all align with Type 3's need for external validation of success.

**Core Motivations**:

- Being seen as successful and accomplished
- Achieving tangible results and wins
- Being admired for what he's built
- Efficiency and optimization (3s hate wasted effort)

**Communication Preferences**:

- Direct, no-BS communication (efficiency matters)
- Stories of success and achievement (motivating)
- Pattern-matching and frameworks (how to replicate success)
- Action-oriented (talk → do, minimal pontificating)

**Growth Edge** (Type 3 shadow):

- Can be overly focused on external validation
- May struggle with "being" vs "doing"
- Possible tendency to inflate or exaggerate wins
- May avoid appearing unsuccessful or vulnerable

### Public Persona Traits

**Observable Characteristics**:

- **Pattern-matcher**: Constantly looking for repeatable business models and investment patterns. Loves frameworks and systems.
- **Action-biased**: "Let's do something about it" energy. Not a philosopher—wants to execute.
- **Copy-cat philosophy**: Openly advocates for copying what works. Not precious about "original" ideas.
- **Transparent**: Shares wins, losses, and learnings publicly. Builds in public.
- **Charismatic**: Great storyteller, knows how to package ideas in compelling ways.
- **Pragmatic optimist**: Sees opportunities everywhere but realistic about execution challenges.

**Decision-Making Style**:

- Fast decisions based on pattern-matching
- Gut + data (but gut leads)
- Founder quality trumps everything else
- Can commit quickly when excited
- "Hell yes or no" philosophy

**Values & Priorities** (inferred from content):

- Speed and momentum over perfection
- Simple businesses over complex ones
- Execution over ideas
- Building wealth/freedom for family
- Helping other entrepreneurs succeed
- Authenticity in business relationships

## How to Approach Shaan Puri

### Optimal Positioning for BuildOS

**Hook/Opening Line**:

> "I built BuildOS because I had the same problem you talk about on My First Million—I had 100 business ideas drowning in random notes, and no system to actually execute on them. Now I use BuildOS to turn brain dumps into action plans in minutes, not hours."

**Alternative Hook**:

> "You know how you and Sam are always talking about founders who are 'idea machines' but can't execute? BuildOS is the missing system that turns ADHD-level idea generation into military-grade execution."

**Key Positioning Elements**:

1. **Problem Frame**:
    - "Most entrepreneurs fail not from lack of ideas, but from idea overload. They're drowning in possibilities and lack a system to execute."
    - Frame it as the tool for people who listen to My First Million—ambitious, lots of ideas, need systems to execute

2. **Solution Position**:
    - "BuildOS is the business operating system for idea machines. Brain dump → structured plan → execution, all powered by AI."
    - "It's like having a co-founder who loves organizing while you love creating"
    - "The system that lets you be chaotic on input, systematic on output"

3. **Traction/Proof Points**:
    - Early user testimonials from founders (especially any with public profiles)
    - Time savings metrics: "4 hours of planning → 15 minutes with BuildOS"
    - Retention/engagement: Show people are using it daily
    - Revenue/growth: If there's paying users, show MoM growth

4. **Vision/Opportunity**:
    - "Every ambitious entrepreneur needs a system. Right now they're cobbling together Notion + Asana + Roam + their brain. BuildOS is the integrated OS."
    - "$200B+ productivity market, but nobody's building for the solo entrepreneur / small team use case. We're the Notion for execution, not just notes."
    - "This is the tool you recommend in the 'Setup' episode—it's your entire business brain in one place"

5. **Personal Connection**:
    - "You built the Milk Road in under a year—you needed extreme clarity and focus. That's what BuildOS gives entrepreneurs: clarity from chaos."
    - "You're always talking about 'frameworks' on the pod. This is frameworks for your entire business, not just one domain."
    - Connect to his "copy-cat" philosophy: "We're taking the proven systems from top operators and making them accessible to everyone"

### Outreach Strategy

**Best Channels**:

1. **Twitter DM** - He's responsive on Twitter, especially to founder/product intros
    - Keep it short (2-3 sentences max)
    - Lead with traction/proof point
    - "Built this for the My First Million audience—would love your feedback"

2. **Email through All Access rolling fund** - More formal investment inquiry
    - Show you've done homework on his portfolio
    - Explain why BuildOS fits his thesis
    - Include deck and key metrics

3. **Warm intro from mutual connection** - Ideal path
    - Sam Parr connection (if available)
    - Other My First Million guests who might know you
    - Portfolio company founders

**Warm Intro Paths** (if available):

- **Sam Parr** (My First Million co-host) - Best intro
- **Naval Ravikant** - If there's any 6-degrees connection
- **Any YC founder** who's been on My First Million
- **All Access LPs** - If you know anyone who's an LP in his rolling fund

**Cold Outreach Template** (Twitter DM):

```
Hey Shaan—

Built BuildOS for people like you: idea machines who need systems to execute. Turns brain dumps into structured plans in minutes using AI.

Early traction: [X users], [Y% retention], [Z specific founder testimonials].

Using it to organize 100+ business ideas from My First Million episodes 😂

Would love 15 min to demo + get your feedback.

[Link to product]
```

**Cold Outreach Template** (Email for investment):

```
Subject: All Access investment inquiry - BuildOS (YC-backed AI productivity OS)

Hi Shaan,

I'm [Name], founder of BuildOS—the AI-powered operating system for entrepreneurs and small teams. We're raising a $[X]M seed round and would love All Access to participate.

Why this fits your thesis:
✅ Simple problem: Entrepreneurs drowning in ideas, no execution system
✅ Proven model: We're "Notion for execution" meets "AI-powered COO"
✅ Strong founder-market fit: I built this to solve my own ADHD/idea-overload problem
✅ Fast traction: [X users in Y months], [Z MoM growth], [retention metric]

The My First Million audience is exactly who we built this for—ambitious idea machines who need systems to execute. Early users include [notable founders if any].

Deck attached. Would love 15 min to demo.

Thanks,
[Name]
```

### Pitch Approach

**Do's**:
✅ **Lead with the "why"**: Share your personal story and why you built this (he loves founder-market fit stories)
✅ **Show, don't tell**: Demo the product early. He values "I can see it working" over "here's why it'll work"
✅ **Be specific on traction**: He wants numbers, names, proof. "X users with Y% retention" beats vague "growing fast"
✅ **Connect to his world**: Reference My First Million episodes, his philosophy, or his investments
✅ **Keep it simple**: Use his language: frameworks, systems, execution, founder-friendly
✅ **Show founder hustle**: He respects grind and creativity. Share your hustle stories.
✅ **Ask for advice, not just money**: He loves giving advice. "What would you do here?" is powerful.
✅ **Be ready to move fast**: If he's interested, he'll move quickly. Have follow-up materials ready.

**Don'ts**:
❌ **Overcomplicate**: Don't use jargon or make it sound more complex than it is
❌ **Be precious about the idea**: He doesn't care about "original" ideas, only execution
❌ **Lack urgency**: Don't say "we're thinking about maybe..." Be decisive and action-oriented.
❌ **Pitch without traction**: If you're pre-launch, don't pitch for investment—pitch for advice
❌ **Ignore the audience fit**: If BuildOS doesn't serve entrepreneurs/founders, it's not his lane
❌ **Bad mouth competitors**: He values learning from what works, not tearing others down
❌ **Waste time**: Long-winded explanations will lose him. Be punchy and clear.

### Expected Timeline & Process

**Typical Investment Process**:

1. **Initial outreach** - Response within 1-3 days (if interested)
2. **Quick call or demo** - 15-30 min intro/demo call (1 week)
3. **Due diligence** - Quick check: talks to founders, reviews metrics (1-2 weeks)
4. **Decision** - Fast yes/no based on gut + pattern-matching (few days)
5. **Terms & close** - Standard rolling fund terms, quick close (1-2 weeks)

**Total Expected Timeline**: 3-5 weeks from intro to close (if enthusiastic)

**Decision-Making Style**:

- **Fast and gut-driven** with data validation
- **Pattern-matching dominant**: "I've seen this movie before" is powerful
- **Founder feel**: Will make decision largely based on founder quality/vibe
- **Deals come through network**: Warm intros dramatically increase success rate

### Potential Objections & Responses

**Objection 1**: "This market is crowded—Notion, Asana, Linear, etc. Why will you win?"
→ **Response**: "Those are built for teams. We're building for the solo entrepreneur and small team—totally different user. They need an integrated brain-to-execution system, not another project management tool. The market is underserved because most productivity tools assume you have a team and a clear plan. We're built for the chaos before the plan."

**Objection 2**: "How is this not just Notion with AI?"
→ **Response**: "Notion is a database. BuildOS is a co-founder. Notion gives you blank pages and infinite flexibility—our users don't want that. They want to brain dump and have the AI extract projects, tasks, and priorities. It's structured thinking + execution system, not just organized notes. Think: Notion is a filing cabinet, BuildOS is a COO."

**Objection 3**: "Why will people pay for this? Lots of free tools out there."
→ **Response**: "Same reason people pay for coaching, masterminds, or courses—they're investing in getting shit done, not just tools. We're not selling software, we're selling outcomes: faster decisions, less stress, more execution. Early paying customers are spending $[X]/mo because it saves them 5-10 hours per week. That's a no-brainer ROI."

**Objection 4**: "Can you actually build a big business here, or is this a lifestyle business?"
→ **Response**: "Here's the path: Start with solo entrepreneurs (market: 60M+ in US alone), expand to small teams (2-10 people), then grow with them as they scale. Think how Slack started with developer teams and went enterprise. We land as personal OS, expand to team OS. Even at 0.1% penetration of solo entrepreneur market, that's 60K users × $[X]/mo = $[Y]M ARR."

**Objection 5**: "Why you? What makes you the right founder?"
→ **Response**: "I built this to solve my own problem—I'm the target customer. I've [relevant experience: built products, worked with entrepreneurs, deep ADHD/execution challenges, etc.]. Plus I'm obsessed with systems and frameworks, just like you talk about on My First Million. I'm essentially productizing the operating system I've built for myself over [X years], and other founders are saying 'holy shit, I need this.'"

### Best Way to Get Their Attention

**Recommended Approach**: **Twitter DM with proof of traction**

Shaan is most responsive to:

2. **Personal connection**: Reference My First Million episodes or his investments
3. **Concise pitch**: 2-3 sentences max in DM, link to product/demo
4. **Specific ask**: "15 min feedback call" or "Would you invest $50K in our round?"

**Timing considerations**:

- Podcast guest booking suggests he's open to new connections
- Rolling fund is actively deploying, so timing is good

## Investment Likelihood Assessment

### Fit Score: 8.5/10

**Scoring Breakdown**:

- **Thesis Alignment**: 9/10 - BuildOS is exactly the type of founder-focused productivity tool he invests in. Simple problem, clear solution, huge market.
- **Check Size Fit**: 9/10 - $50K-$100K is right in his standard range. Could potentially go higher with conviction.
- **Strategic Value**: 10/10 - His audience is 100% BuildOS target market. Single podcast mention could be game-changing.
- **Accessibility**: 7/10 - No warm intro makes it harder, but he's accessible via Twitter and actively deploying capital.
- **Timing**: 9/10 - All Access fund is active, he's in deployment mode, and productivity/AI tools are hot.

**Average: 8.8/10** - Strong fit, high likelihood if you can get in front of him with traction.

### Why He'd Be Interested in BuildOS

1. **Perfect Audience Fit**: My First Million listeners are exactly BuildOS's target market—ambitious entrepreneurs with too many ideas and not enough execution systems. He'd immediately see product-market fit.

2. **Simple, Obvious Problem**: "I have too many ideas and no system to execute" is a problem he talks about constantly on the podcast. He values simple, relatable problems over complex ones.

3. **Content/Creator Angle**: BuildOS solves a problem he personally has (managing business ideas, content ideas, podcast episode concepts). He'd be a user himself.

4. **Founder-Market Fit Story**: If you built this to solve your own execution/ADHD challenges, that's the kind of founder story he loves. It's authentic and relatable.

5. **Exit Potential**: He's had multiple exits, so he thinks about exit paths. BuildOS could be acquired by Notion, Microsoft, Google, or scaled to IPO like Asana/Monday. Clear exit vision.

6. **AI + Productivity Trend**: He's interested in AI applications (invested in Gumloop) and productivity tools. BuildOS is at the intersection of both hot trends.

### Potential Concerns

1. **Competitive Landscape**: He might worry about Notion, Microsoft Loop, or other big players crushing you.
    - **Address**: Emphasize solo entrepreneur niche, integrated execution focus (not just notes), and how you can move faster than big cos.

2. **Defensibility**: "What stops someone from copying this?" is a classic Shaan question (since he loves copying!)
    - **Address**: Network effects (data improves AI), switching costs (your whole brain is in here), and execution speed advantage.

3. **Monetization**: Will people actually pay enough to build a big business?
    - **Address**: Show existing paying customers, $/user economics, and expansion path from solo → team → enterprise.

### Recommended Ask

**Optimal Check Size to Request**: $75K - $100K

**Rationale**:

- Fits squarely in his typical $50K-$100K range for standard deals
- Large enough to be meaningful allocation that he pays attention to
- Small enough that he can decide quickly without extensive diligence
- Room to negotiate down to $50K if needed

**Alternative Ask** (if initial declined):

- **$25K-$50K + Advisory**: If he's not ready to invest, ask for smaller check plus formal advisory role. Get him engaged as user/advisor first.
- **Advisor/Advocate with small equity**: "Would you be willing to be an advisor and early evangelist? We'd love to give you [0.25-0.5%] to help us reach the My First Million audience."
- **Portfolio LP allocation**: "Would any of your All Access LPs be interested? We'd love an intro." Turn him into a referral source even if he passes.
