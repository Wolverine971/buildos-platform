## Architecture Insights

### Fundraising Strategy Framework

**Trust-Building Approach** (vs. immediate fundraising):

1. **Seeking Strategic Input**: "Getting perspectives from operators who've built at scale"
2. **Building Relationships**: "Connecting with investors who understand [military/YC/AI] space"
3. **Sharing Progress**: "Wanted to share what we're building in case it's relevant"
4. **Advisory Interest**: "Exploring advisory relationships with domain experts"

### Military Founder Positioning Advantages

- **Decision-making under pressure**: Demonstrated through Curri integration work
- **Systematic thinking**: Applied to BuildOS architecture and user workflows
- **Operational excellence**: Military training translated to startup execution
- **Long-term vision**: Strategic thinking beyond immediate tactical wins

### Technical Differentiation Strategy

- **AI-Native vs. AI-Retrofit**: Core architectural advantage over existing tools
- **Complex Coordination**: Multi-system integration creating defensible moats
- **Founder-Market Fit**: Unique combination of military + YC + AI expertise
- **Category Creation**: Productivity platform for AI era, not incremental improvement

## Historical Context (from research)

### Existing BuildOS Fundraising Strategy

From `docs/marketing/investors/buildos-fundraising-strategy.md`:

- **Target**: $3-5M Seed Round with 18-month runway
- **Tier 1 Targets**: AIX Ventures, Point Nine Capital, First Round Capital, Character VC
- **Positioning**: "AI-native productivity operating system" for knowledge workers
- **Current Metrics**: Need to be updated with specific traction data

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. **Gather Missing Context**: Military background details, Curri metrics, BuildOS traction
2. **Prioritize Top 3**: Start with Tim Hsia, Paige Craig, and Tom Blomfield
3. **Prepare Evidence**: Document systematic execution examples and technical architecture
4. **Research Warm Intros**: Leverage YC network and military veteran connections

### Outreach Sequence (Weeks 2-4)

1. **Tim Hsia**: Military-to-military connection, highest probability response
2. **Tom Blomfield**: YC alumni connection, established relationship path
