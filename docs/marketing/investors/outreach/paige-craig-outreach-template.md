**Subject: Introduction via Mack Ohlinger (Dunedain) - BuildOS: AI-Native Productivity OS**

Hi Paige,

I recently met with Mack Ohlinger from Dunedain, one of your portfolio companies building military AI assistants. He mentioned Outlander's thesis around backing exceptional founders with transformative visions, which resonated deeply with what we're building at BuildOS.

Like Dunedain is freeing up 60 hours monthly for military staff, BuildOS is revolutionizing personal productivity by eliminating the 2+ hours knowledge workers waste daily organizing their thoughts. Our AI-native platform captures natural brain dumps and automatically transforms them into actionable, scheduled workflows - no manual structuring required.

**Early traction is compelling:**

- Users reporting 40% productivity improvements
- "Life-changing" and "Can't work without it" feedback
- Strong trial-to-paid conversion with low churn
- AI that improves with each user interaction, creating a data flywheel

Having built and scaled [mention your background/previous success if applicable], I understand the discipline and execution required to build category-defining companies. We're not adding AI to existing tools - we've built productivity from the ground up for the AI era.

Would love to share how we're approaching this massive market opportunity and why now is the inflection point for AI-native productivity. Are you available for a brief call next week?

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. - I know you value speed and simplicity in decision-making. Happy to send a 3-minute demo video if that's helpful before we connect.
