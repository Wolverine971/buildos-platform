# Dennis Mortensen - Advisory Outreach Email Template

## Context & Important Note

- **Role**: CEO/Founder LaunchBrightly (automated screenshots for SaaS)
- **Background**: x.ai founder (AI scheduling), 5 startups, 3 exits
- **Investment Status**: ⚠️ **Does NOT angel invest** - focuses exclusively on own ventures
- **Outreach Approach**: Advisory/peer consultation, NOT investment

### Specific Common Ground Opportunities

- **AI Productivity Focus**: Both building AI-powered workflow automation tools
- **Enterprise Integration**: Military logistics experience, his x.ai enterprise adoption challenges
- **Systematic Problem-Solving**: Military operational thinking, his "hate list" problem validation methodology
- **Startup Building Philosophy**: Understanding that entrepreneurship requires long-term commitment
- **Technical Implementation**: Hands-on approach to building complex AI systems
- **SaaS Business Models**: Understanding recurring revenue and customer success metrics
- **Workflow Automation**: Military process optimization, his AI scheduling coordination
- **Serial Entrepreneur Mindset**: Focus on execution over theory and proven business building

### How Dennis Likely Feels About Current Market (Late 2024/Early 2025)

**AI Productivity Reality Check**: "Most AI productivity tools are solving the wrong problems. x.ai taught me that enterprise workflow automation is much harder than demos suggest. Military + logistics background might actually understand the operational complexity that most founders miss."

**Entrepreneur vs. Investor Fatigue**: "Too many successful entrepreneurs become investors instead of continuing to build. I'm focused on LaunchBrightly because I believe in staying operational. Military founders understand the importance of staying mission-focused."

**Enterprise AI Adoption Cycles**: "AI adoption in enterprise is slower than everyone expects. x.ai was ahead of its time. Military experience with technology adoption timelines and change management could be valuable for BuildOS enterprise strategy."

**Systematic Building Appreciation**: "The founders who succeed in AI productivity understand that it's not about the AI - it's about understanding user workflows and operational reality. Military operational experience suggests you might actually get this."

**LaunchBrightly Focus**: "I'm heads-down on solving automated screenshots for SaaS companies. But I appreciate connecting with other founders solving adjacent workflow problems. There might be synergies between our user bases."

**Startup Advice Willingness**: "While I don't invest, I'm happy to share lessons from x.ai about AI workflow challenges, enterprise sales cycles, and product-market fit in the productivity space. Military + YC backgrounds suggest you'd actually implement advice rather than just collect it."

## Email Template

**Subject**: Fellow AI Productivity Entrepreneur - Seeking Perspective on Enterprise AI Adoption

Hi Dennis,

I'm [Name], founder of BuildOS, an AI-native productivity platform for teams. Like you with x.ai, I'm tackling the workflow automation space but from a different angle - comprehensive productivity workflows rather than meeting scheduling.

I've been following your journey from x.ai through to LaunchBrightly and particularly resonated with your "hate list" approach to problem validation. Having built my own integration systems at Curri (YC S19) connecting to Uber/Lyft/DoorDash, I understand the complexity of enterprise workflow automation.

I'm facing [specific challenge - e.g., "enterprise AI adoption cycles" or "balancing AI capability with user trust"] and would value perspective from someone who's navigated similar waters with x.ai's AI assistants.

Would you be open to a brief peer conversation? I'm not seeking investment (know you stay focused on your own ventures) but would appreciate insights about [specific topic relevant to his experience].

Happy to share what we've learned about [relevant area] in return.

Best regards,
[Name]

BuildOS Founder
Former Software Engineer, Curri (YC S19)
