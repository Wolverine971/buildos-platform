## Investment Approach at Y Combinator

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Selection Process**: "Each of the partners has access to the entire application pool. But if I read an application and I'm the first one to say, yes, that's mine, then I get to interview it"
- **Portfolio**: 119 partner investments according to Crunchbase
- **Notable Investment**: Alaan (AI-powered expense management, 9x net revenue growth 2023, 6x in 2024)

### Investment Philosophy

#### Core Principles

- **Outlier Focus**: "VC returns are extremely skewed by a tiny number of outsized successes... 70% will fail, 29% might make modest returns, but 1% will be worth 1000x"
- **Upside Potential**: Focus on "if this is wildly successful, how big could it be?" rather than downside mitigation
- **Power Law Understanding**: Investment decisions driven by fear of missing the next massive success

#### AI & Technology Perspective

- **AI Transformation**: "About a quarter of the recent YC batch wrote 95%+ of their code using AI"
- **Speed Advantage**: "The companies in the most recent batch are the fastest-growing ever in the history of Y Combinator"
- **Application Layer Focus**: Values practical AI applications over infrastructure
- **Developer Productivity**: "It is possible for teams of five engineers using cutting-edge tools to build products that previously took 50 engineers"

## Founder Evaluation Criteria

### What Tom Looks For

#### Essential Traits

- **Contrarian Mindset**: "Because you have to be, in a sense, contrarian. If you just agree with everything that happens around you, you're never going to create something different"
- **Exceptionalism**: Looks for unique achievements or skills that set founders apart
- **Early Entrepreneurial Signs**: Childhood business attempts can indicate future success
- **Creative Problem-Solving**: Asks "Tell me about a non-computer system you've hacked to your advantage"

#### Red Flags

- "If someone blindly accepts everything you say without thinking, not great"
- "If they come to you with every small decision, they're not going to be a great founder"
- Founders who can't make independent decisions
- Over-reliance on advisors for basic decisions

#### Preferred Founder Profile

- **Independent Decision-Making**: Values founders who think critically about advice
- **Optimistic Ambition**: Appreciates founders who "pitch the top one percent outcome"
- **Execution Balance**: Must balance visionary thinking with immediate execution
- **Determination**: "Determination and a strong drive to fix problems are more critical" than likability

---

## YC Application & Pitching Advice

### Interview Process

- **Format**: 10-minute Zoom calls with 2-3 YC partners
- **Structure**: "We only do two things at interviews: we ask you questions, and we look at what you've built so far"
- **Direct Style**: Partners can be very direct - example: "So we love your backgrounds, but we hate your idea"

### Application Best Practices

#### Critical Success Factors

- **Build First**: "The biggest mistake I see first-time founders make. Trying to raise money from VCs with just an idea and a pitch deck is extraordinarily difficult"
- **Show Progress**: "If you really want to improve your chances of getting into YC, the best way to get an edge is to work hard and have your startup improve between the time that you applied and the time that you interview"
- **Avoid Over-Preparation**: "Beyond basic preparation... it is not useful and is often counter-productive. You don't need to do mock interview prep"

#### What to Demonstrate

- Rapid iteration and learning between application and interview
- Customer traction and product development
- Ability to execute quickly under pressure
- Clear thinking about the problem and solution
