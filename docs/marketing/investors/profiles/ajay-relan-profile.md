Hi Ajay,

I'm [Name], and I'm building [product] because of a cultural insight I had as [background/community member].

I noticed [cultural trend/gap] - traditional [category] tools ignore [underserved community's] needs around [specific cultural need]. We're changing this by [unique cultural approach].

Early community validation shows this resonates: [organic growth metrics, word-of-mouth, community engagement].
