## Investment Philosophy & Approach

### Core Investment Principles

**"Venture capital is a game of purely upside maximization"**

- Focus on unlimited upside potential over downside protection
- "The way you make money in venture capital is by backing the truck in and being correct"
- Anti-consensus approach: "I'm not looking for validation from other VC firms at all"

### Founder Evaluation Framework

**The "IT" Factor - What He Looks For**:

1. **Self-Awareness**: Know their unique strengths and supplement weaknesses with other people
2. **Authenticity**: Never virtue signal; always speak their mind directly
3. **Respect for Expertise**: Don't know everything, but respect their own areas of expertise
4. **Technical Vision**: Comparable to innovators like Elon Musk
5. **Team Building Ability**: Can assemble elite teams with complementary skills

### Investment Criteria

**"Teams + Moats + Strategies > Everything Else"**

- **Teams**: Exceptional founders with complementary skill sets
- **Moats**: "Good moats should be obvious. Good software will get cloned; you need something else."
- **Strategies**: Clear path to becoming one of the world's most important companies

### Red Flags & Turn-Offs

- **Lack of self-awareness** about personal strengths and weaknesses
- **Virtue signaling** instead of direct, honest communication
- **Theoretical moats** - companies that pitch what their moat "will look like"
- **Trend following** rather than creating transformative solutions
- **Over-reliance on spreadsheets** vs. gut-feel evaluation

---

## Current Venture: GPx Fund (2025)

### Fund Details

- **Size**: Seeking $500M+
- **Co-founder**: Lee Linden (Quiet Capital managing partner)
- **Major Backer**: Peter Thiel contributing up to 50% of fund capital
- **Launch**: Active fundraising as of July 2025

### Innovative Investment Model

**Hybrid Fund-of-Funds Approach**:

- **20% Allocation**: Investments into emerging VC funds (pre-seed/seed stage)
- **80% Allocation**: Partnership with emerging managers for later-stage investments (Series B)
- **Strategic Advantage**: Enables smaller VCs to maintain ownership stakes through growth rounds

### Investment Focus Areas

- **Healthcare & Biotechnology**: Complex life sciences investments
- **Defense Technology**: Autonomous systems and AI applications
- **AI Infrastructure**: Practical applications in defense and healthcare
- **Wearable Computing & Robotics**: Next-generation hardware/software integration

---

## Evaluation Process & Pitching Strategy

### Decision-Making Approach

- **Gut-driven evaluation**: "There's a certain gut feel" - evolved to be more intuitive
- **Single meeting assessment**: Can determine founder potential in one dinner
- **Sector-agnostic**: "Very very very dogma free and open to anything that walks in the door"
- **No standardized process**: "Different people, different evaluation processes"

### What Makes a Compelling Pitch

**Essential Elements**:

1. **Existing moats**, not theoretical ones
2. **Complex coordination** that's hard to replicate
3. **Massive market opportunity** - potential to become "world's most important company"
4. **Founder-market fit** - unique positioning to solve the problem
5. **Clear team strategy** - how weaknesses will be addressed

### Key Philosophy

_"When you find a phenomenal founder, you back them regardless of what they are doing"_
