## Why He's NOT an Investor

### Explicit Anti-Investment Philosophy

> "Entrepreneur != Angel Investor. If you are a little bit successful as a founder, folks assume you are on a path to angel investing... I've never been a fan of this. And it is not that it wouldn't be fun, but bringing any new venture to life is so hard, or near impossible actually, that any outside distraction you can remove directly increases the probability of success."

> "Dennis refuses to do anything else other than focusing on his startups. No boards, no investing, just focus."

### Focus Philosophy

- Believes successful entrepreneurs should continue building rather than becoming investors
- "Hyperfocus, urgency, radical transparency and a single KPI have become part of his process"
- Eliminates any outside distractions that could reduce probability of success

## Entrepreneurial Philosophy (Relevant for Understanding His Mindset)

### Problem-First Approach

- Keeps a "list of hate" - writes down every nuisance or annoyance
- When a problem appears multiple times, he searches for a solution
- "Genuinely hating a problem is the number one reason for motivation and success in solving it"

### What He Values in Entrepreneurship

1. **Problem-Obsessed Founders**: Those who genuinely hate the problem they're solving
2. **Focused Execution**: Avoiding distractions and maintaining singular focus
3. **Customer Intimacy**: "Super close to the customer... it constantly reminds you why you're here"
4. **Sales Experience**: Credits early door-to-door sales as crucial entrepreneurial training
5. **Experimental Mindset**: Views ventures as experiments, not failures
6. **Persistence**: "You aren't going to hit the jackpot unless you keep rolling"
