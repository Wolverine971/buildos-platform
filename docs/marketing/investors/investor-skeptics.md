# BuildOS Investor Messaging - Skeptics

## Core Positioning

**Frame:** Market validation, differentiation, and sustainable growth in an overlooked segment

## The One-Liner

"While everyone's chasing AI agents, we're solving a validated problem for 10M+ people with ADHD who have an 89% abandonment rate with existing productivity tools."

## Key Messages for Different Concerns

### "The productivity market is saturated"

**Response:**
"You're right - for neurotypical users. But 8-10% of adults have ADHD, and existing tools have an 89% abandonment rate in this segment. Notion, Monday, Asana - they're all built for linear thinkers.

We're not competing for the same users. We're serving the millions who've tried and abandoned every mainstream tool. Our early retention data shows 77% still active after 30 days - that's 3x the industry standard for ADHD users."

**Data points:**

- 15M+ adults with ADHD in the US alone
- $2.8B underserved market
- Average ADHD adult tries 7+ productivity tools
- 89% abandon within 2 weeks

### "AI is just hype"

**Response:**
"Agreed - AI agents are overhyped. That's exactly why we're different. We use AI for one specific job: organizing scattered thoughts into clear next steps. Not replacing human judgment. Not autonomous agents. Just pattern recognition and organization.

Think of it as autocomplete for productivity - helpful, not revolutionary. The revolution is making tools that actually work for neurodivergent brains."

**Proof points:**

- No complex agent framework
- Simple NLP for categorization
- Users maintain full control
- AI cost per user: <$0.50/month

### "How is this different from Notion AI?"

**Response:**
"Notion added AI to a complex product. We built simplicity first, AI second.

Notion requires users to build their system. ADHD brains can't do that consistently. BuildOS has one flow: dump thoughts → see organization → schedule action. No templates to choose. No databases to design. No decision fatigue.

We're not better than Notion. We're different. Built for the people Notion loses."

**Differentiation table:**
| Notion | BuildOS |
|--------|---------|
| 100+ features | 5 core features |
| User builds system | System pre-built |
| AI assists existing complexity | AI creates simplicity |
| $10-20/month | $15/month |
| 11% ADHD retention | 77% ADHD retention |

### "This seems niche"

**Response:**
"Niche markets create billion-dollar companies. Calm started with anxiety. Headspace with meditation skeptics. Duolingo with ADHD-friendly language learning.

ADHD productivity is a $2.8B market growing 23% annually. But here's the key: we're starting with ADHD because they're the canaries in the coal mine. What works for ADHD brains works for everyone under stress.

Our roadmap: ADHD (Year 1) → Overwhelmed professionals (Year 2) → Mainstream (Year 3)."

**Market expansion path:**

1. **Beachhead:** 15M ADHD adults (US)
2. **Expansion:** 50M overwhelmed professionals
3. **Mainstream:** 200M knowledge workers
4. **Global:** 1B+ productivity tool users

### "What's your moat?"

**Response:**
"Three layers:

1. **Product-market fit in an underserved segment:** We're the only tool with >50% ADHD retention after 30 days

2. **Compounding context value:** Every brain dump enriches user's project context. After 30 days, switching cost is high - not features, but accumulated understanding

3. **Community moat:** ADHD users are incredibly loyal to tools that actually work for them. 62% of signups come from referrals"

**Defensive positions:**

- First-mover in ADHD-first productivity
- Founder with ADHD (authenticity)
- Growing context library per user
- Community-driven development

### "Revenue model seems limited"

**Response:**
"B2C SaaS is just phase one. The real opportunity is in B2B2C.

Companies lose $13,000 per ADHD employee annually in productivity loss. We're building enterprise partnerships where companies subsidize BuildOS for neurodivergent employees. Three Fortune 500 companies already interested in pilots.

Revenue evolution:

- Year 1: Direct B2C ($15/month)
- Year 2: B2B2C partnerships
- Year 3: API/platform for ADHD-accessible tools"

**Revenue projections:**

- Year 1: $180K ARR (1,000 users)
- Year 2: $900K ARR (5,000 users)
- Year 3: $3.6M ARR (12K users + enterprise)

### "Team concerns"

**Response:**
"Solo founder, yes. But:

- Built and sold previous startup
- 10 years engineering experience
- Personal connection to problem (ADHD)
- Already achieved product-market fit signals

Hiring plan funded:

- Month 1: Senior engineer
- Month 3: Growth marketer
- Month 6: Customer success lead"

## Risk Mitigation

### Competition Risk

"Large players could add ADHD features, but they won't simplify core products. Their existing users expect complexity. We're unbundling productivity for a specific audience."

### Market Risk

"ADHD diagnosis rates growing 5% annually. Mental health awareness is mainstream. This market is expanding, not contracting."

### Execution Risk

"Already built MVP, have paying users, clear roadmap. Not 'will we build it?' but 'how fast can we scale?'"

## The Close

"Look, I understand the skepticism. Another productivity tool, more AI integration - I get it.

But here's what's different: We're not trying to win the entire productivity market. We're solving a specific, painful, validated problem for millions of people everyone else ignores.

Traditional tools have had 20 years to serve ADHD brains. They've failed. We're building what they can't: radical simplicity powered by just enough AI.

This isn't about building the next Notion. It's about serving the people Notion leaves behind. That's a billion-dollar opportunity hiding in plain sight."

## Appendix: Quick Rebuttals

**"Just a feature, not a company"**
→ "Calm was just meditation. Duolingo was just gamified flashcards."

**"ADHD is overdiagnosed"**
→ "Even at half the diagnosed rate, it's a $1.4B market"

**"Too simple to be valuable"**
→ "WhatsApp: simple messaging. Worth $19B"

**"Solo founder is risky"**
→ "GitLab, PlentyOfFish, Minecraft - all started solo"

**"Why wouldn't Google/Microsoft do this?"**
→ "Same reason they didn't build Notion or Roam"

Subject: "Not another AI productivity play"

Hi [Name],

I know you're seeing 50 AI-powered productivity pitches a week. This isn't that.

BuildOS serves the 15M adults with ADHD who've abandoned Notion, Monday, and every other complex tool. We're seeing 77% retention after 30 days - 3x the industry standard for this segment.

The twist: We use AI for organization, not automation. No agents. No hype. Just helping scattered minds find clarity.

Early numbers:

- 200 beta users
- 62% from referrals
- Users calling it their "home base" within 2 weeks
- CAC: $12, LTV: $540

Would love 15 minutes to show you why this overlooked market is a massive opportunity.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. I have ADHD. I built this because I needed it. The market validation is personal.
