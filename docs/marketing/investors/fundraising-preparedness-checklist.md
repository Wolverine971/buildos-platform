# BuildOS Fundraising Preparedness Checklist & Strategy Guide

## Welcome, Anna 👋

Hey there! Think of me as your Silicon Valley VC friend who's been on both sides of the table. I've reviewed your existing materials and I'm going to help you navigate this fundraising journey step by step.

First, let's talk about your raise amount. You're thinking $100K minimum to $500K ideal - that's smart positioning for a pre-seed/friends & family round. Here's my take:

### 🎯 Your Raise Amount Strategy

**My Recommendation: Target $350K with a range of $250K-500K**

Here's why:

- **$100K** is too little - barely 6 months runway even living lean. VCs will worry you'll need money again too soon
- **$250K** gives you 12-15 months solo (reasonable minimum)
- **$350K** is the sweet spot - 12 months solo OR 6-8 months with a part-time founding engineer
- **$500K** lets you be aggressive with hiring and gives 18+ months runway

**Remember**: Always raise more than you think you need. Fundraising takes 3-6 months away from building.

## 📋 The Master Checklist

I'm breaking this down into must-haves, should-haves, and nice-to-haves. Focus on the must-haves first.

### ✅ MUST-HAVES (Complete These First)

#### 1. **Core Numbers & Metrics**

- [ ] Current Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- [ ] Number of users (total, active, paying)
- [ ] Growth rate (month-over-month %)
- [ ] Burn rate (how much you spend monthly)
- [ ] Runway (months until you run out of money)

**🤔 Questions for you:**

- What's your current MRR? Even if it's $0, that's fine - just be clear
- How many users do you have? Beta users count!
- What's your current monthly burn rate? (Include all expenses)

#### 2. **The Story & Vision**

- [ ] 30-second elevator pitch (memorized)
- [ ] 2-minute founder story (why YOU building THIS)
- [ ] Problem statement (1 clear sentence)
- [ ] Solution (how you uniquely solve it)
- [ ] Vision for the next 12-18 months

**🤔 Questions for you:**

- What sparked the idea for BuildOS? Was there a specific moment?
- What's your unfair advantage? (Your USMC background + technical skills is already interesting)
- Where do you see BuildOS in 18 months if everything goes right?

#### 3. **Basic Pitch Deck (10 slides)**

You don't need perfection, just clarity:

1. [ ] Title slide (company name, tagline, your name)
2. [ ] Problem (the pain you're solving)
3. [ ] Solution (your unique approach)
4. [ ] Product demo/screenshots (show, don't just tell)
5. [ ] Business model (how you make money)
6. [ ] Traction (any users, revenue, or progress)
7. [ ] Market size (TAM/SAM/SOM)
8. [ ] Competition (and why you're different)
9. [ ] Team (why you're the one to build this)
10. [ ] The Ask (how much raising, what you'll do with it)

#### 4. **Legal & Administrative**

- [ ] Incorporated (Delaware C-corp is standard)
- [ ] Bank account for the company
- [ ] Basic cap table (who owns what %)
- [ ] IP assignment (make sure company owns the code)

**🤔 Questions for you:**

- Are you incorporated? If yes, where? If no, we need to fix this ASAP
- Do you have any existing investors or advisors with equity?
- Is all the code assigned to the company?

#### 5. **Product Demo**

- [ ] 2-minute live demo (practice until smooth)
- [ ] Backup demo video (in case of technical issues)
- [ ] Clear before/after user experience story

---

### 💪 SHOULD-HAVES (Complete Within 2 Weeks)

#### 6. **Financial Projections**

Simple is fine at this stage:

- [ ] 18-month P&L projection
- [ ] Customer acquisition cost (CAC) estimate
- [ ] Lifetime value (LTV) estimate
- [ ] Path to profitability or next raise

**🤔 Questions for you:**

- What's your pricing model? The doc mentions $20/month - is that final?
- What's your customer acquisition strategy and estimated cost?
- How much do you need to live on monthly? (Be realistic)

#### 7. **Market Validation**

- [ ] Customer testimonials (even beta users)
- [ ] Screenshots of user feedback
- [ ] Waitlist numbers (if applicable)
- [ ] Letters of intent from potential customers

**🤔 Questions for you:**

- Can you get 3-5 beta users to write quick testimonials?
- Do you track user engagement metrics? Daily/weekly active users?
- Have any users said they'd pay? How much?

#### 8. **Competition Analysis**

- [ ] Feature comparison matrix
- [ ] Pricing comparison
- [ ] Your unique differentiators
- [ ] Why now? (Why does this solution need to exist NOW?)

#### 9. **Use of Funds**

Be specific about how you'll spend the money:

- [ ] Breakdown by category (salary, engineering, marketing, etc.)
- [ ] Key milestones you'll hit with this funding
- [ ] Metrics you'll achieve before next round

---

### 🎁 NICE-TO-HAVES (Can Wait Until Interest)

#### 10. **Additional Materials**

- [ ] One-page executive summary
- [ ] Detailed product roadmap
- [ ] Go-to-market strategy document
- [ ] Technical architecture overview
- [ ] Advisory board (even informal advisors help)

### Essential Terms:

**Pre-seed**: Your stage - earliest institutional money, usually $100K-1M

**SAFE**: Simple Agreement for Future Equity - fastest way to raise (recommended for your round)

**Valuation Cap**: The maximum valuation at which your SAFE converts to equity

**Burn Rate**: How much money you spend monthly

**Runway**: How many months until you run out of money

**MRR/ARR**: Monthly/Annual Recurring Revenue

**CAC**: Customer Acquisition Cost - how much to get a customer

**LTV**: Lifetime Value - how much a customer pays you total

**PMF**: Product-Market Fit - when customers love your product

## 🎭 Common Investor Questions (Be Ready!)

### The Questions You'll Definitely Get:

1. **"Why are you the right person to build this?"**
    - Your technical skills + personal pain point + military discipline is your answer

2. **"What if Notion/Microsoft/Google builds this?"**
    - You're AI-native from day one, they're retrofitting
    - You're focused on LLM context building, they're general productivity

3. **"How do you acquire customers?"**
    - Start with your answer about LLM power users and content marketing

4. **"What's your moat?"**
    - Context accumulation creates switching costs
    - AI-first architecture is hard to replicate

5. **"Why are you a solo founder?"**
    - Be honest but positive: "I'm actively looking for the right technical co-founder"

6. **"How big can this get?"**
    - $50B productivity market, $12B project management market
    - Every knowledge worker is a potential customer

## 🚩 Red Flags to Avoid

### Don't Say These Things:

- "We have no competition" (shows naivety)
- "Our projections are conservative" (they're always optimistic)
- "We'll figure out monetization later" (you need a business model)
- "I'm doing this part-time" (investors want full commitment)
- "I need funding to quit my job" (quit first or have a clear timeline)

### Do Say These Instead:

- "We're differentiated from X because..."
- "Our initial model shows... and we'll test and iterate"
- "Our early users are willing to pay $X for Y value"
- "I'm fully committed and have X months of personal runway"

---

## 📞 Your Next Steps (Let's Talk!)

I need to understand your situation better to give you more specific guidance. Can you answer these questions?

### Critical Questions:

1. **Legal Status**: Are you incorporated? If yes, where and what structure?

2. **Current Traction**:
    - How many users do you have right now?
    - What's your current MRR (even if $0)?
    - What's your strongest traction point to date?

3. **Financial Situation**:
    - What's your current burn rate?
    - How many months of personal runway do you have?
    - Are you working on this full-time?

4. **The Raise**:
    - Do you have any soft commits or interested investors?
    - Do you have any warm connections to investors?
    - What's your timeline? (When do you need the money?)

5. **Founding Team**:
    - Are you actively looking for a co-founder?
    - Would you prefer to stay solo with early employees?
    - Do you have any advisors or mentors?

### The Investor Approach:

Given your situation (solo technical founder, early stage), I'd recommend this approach:

**Start with Angels** → **Then micro-VCs** → **Then traditional VCs**

Angels will move faster and care less about you being solo. They'll also give you credibility for larger investors.

Your military background is actually a strong asset - investors love founder resilience and discipline.

## 🎯 Your Homework (This Week)

1. **Today**: Answer the questions above so I can give you more specific guidance
2. **Tomorrow**: Write your 30-second elevator pitch
3. **Day 3**: Create a simple 10-slide deck (use Google Slides, don't overthink design)
4. **Day 4**: List 20 angel investors who invest in productivity/AI/B2B SaaS
5. **Day 5**: Find warm connections to 5 of those angels
6. **Weekend**: Practice your pitch 20 times and record yourself

---

## 💡 My Insider Tips

### The "VC Mindset" Decoder:

**What VCs Actually Care About:**

1. **Founder quality** (50%) - Can you build this and not give up?
2. **Market size** (30%) - Can this be a billion-dollar company?
3. **Product** (20%) - Is there early validation?

At your stage, it's 80% about YOU and 20% about everything else.

### The "Warm Intro" Hack:

Never cold email. Here's how to get warm intros:

1. Find portfolio companies of target investors
2. Connect with those founders on LinkedIn/Twitter
3. Offer them value (feedback, introductions, etc.)
4. After building relationship, ask for intro

### The "Momentum" Game:

Create FOMO by:

- "I'm talking to several investors and want to make a decision by [date]"
- Share weekly progress updates during fundraising
- Have multiple conversations in parallel
- Never seem desperate (even if you are)

## 🏁 Remember: Fundraising is a Sales Process

You're not asking for a favor - you're offering an opportunity to invest in the future of productivity. Your conviction and energy matter more than perfect materials.

**Your story is compelling**: Military vet turned engineer solving a problem that millions of knowledge workers face. That's powerful.

---

## Let's Get Specific!

Reply with answers to my questions above, and I'll help you:

1. Set the right valuation cap for your SAFE
2. Identify the perfect first 10 investors to approach
3. Craft your unique positioning
4. Fix any critical gaps before you start pitching

You've got this, Anna! The fact that you're building something you use yourself daily is a huge advantage. Dogfooding shows authenticity that investors love.

What questions do you have for me? What part feels most overwhelming right now?

_P.S. - Your existing fundraising strategy doc is actually quite good! You've clearly done your homework. The main gap is translating that strategy into actual materials and getting your story tight. We can definitely get you ready in 2-3 weeks._

_P.P.S. - Don't forget: The best time to raise money is when you don't need it. But the second best time is now, before you run out of runway. Let's move fast but be strategic._
