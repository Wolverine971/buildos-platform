## Brand Differentiators

### What We Stand FOR:

- **Context over statelessness** - AI should remember your work, not start fresh every time
- **Human-centered AI** - Technology amplifies your thinking, doesn't replace it
- **Rich context architecture** - Goals, plans, tasks, documents—all connected
- **Compounding value** - Every day you use BuildOS, your AI gets smarter about YOUR work
- **Progress over perfection** - Next step matters more than grand plans

### What We Stand AGAINST:

- **Stateless AI** - Starting from scratch every conversation is broken
- **Agent hype** - AI should enhance judgment, not replace it (context-first, not agent-first)
- **Productivity theater** - Looking organized vs. actually moving forward
- **Feature bloat** - More features ≠ more productivity
- **Flat task lists** - Tasks without goals, plans, and context are just busywork

"BuildOS is context infrastructure for the AI era. Build context on your projects—goals, plans, tasks, documents—and that context compounds. Your AI finally remembers. Your thinking is never lost."

### Problem-Solution (30 seconds)
