# BuildOS Messaging Pivot: AI Project Collaboration

Last updated: 2026-02-26

## Pivot Goal

Shift the core category framing from **AI project organization** to **AI project collaboration** while keeping organization as an enabling capability.

## Decision Log

- Chosen canonical title phrase: **BuildOS - AI Project Collaboration for the builders**.
- `P0` live product surfaces now reflect collaboration-first wording.
- `P1` and `P2` messaging docs now reflect collaboration-first wording with a final tone pass across business/investor content.
- `P3` internal AI prompt identity text now reflects collaboration-first wording.

## Working Definition

**AI Project Collaboration** means BuildOS acts as a shared context layer between people and AI:

1. **Solo mode:** one person + BuildOS, building context over time.
2. **Team mode:** multiple people + BuildOS, with AI helping transfer knowledge and keep everyone aligned.

## Primary Messaging Stack

- **Core value:** Context that compounds.
- **Core mechanism:** AI facilitates understanding across messy inputs.
- **Core outcome:** Less back-and-forth, faster decisions, everyone in the loop.

## Homepage Copy Block (Recommended V1)

### AI Project Collaboration

- Build context that compounds, whether you're working solo or with a team.
- BuildOS turns scattered updates into shared understanding and clear next steps.
- Keep everyone in the loop and cut status-chasing across tools and conversations.

## Alternate Copy Blocks

### Option A (More direct)

- Start one-to-one with AI, then scale to team collaboration without losing context.
- BuildOS translates notes, chats, and tasks into one project source of truth.
- Spend less time syncing and more time shipping.

### Option B (More operational)

- Build project context once, then reuse it across people and AI.
- AI smooths handoffs by clarifying what changed, what matters, and what's next.
- Replace repetitive check-ins with shared, always-current project intelligence.

### Option C (More founder voice)

- Talk to BuildOS like a second brain, then invite your team into the same context.
- BuildOS keeps the project narrative coherent as contributors and priorities shift.
- Fewer dropped threads. Faster momentum. Clearer collaboration.

## Positioning Notes

- Keep **organization** as supporting language: "organize inputs" and "structure chaos."
- Lead with **collaboration** as the category: people + AI + shared context.
- Reuse current strength: "context compounding" remains the differentiator.

## Open Questions For Iteration

1. Do we explicitly mention teams in the hero subcopy, or keep hero broad and explain team mode below?
2. Should "second brain" language stay in hero copy or move to a supporting section?
