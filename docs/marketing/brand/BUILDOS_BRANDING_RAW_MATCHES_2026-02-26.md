docs/marketing/social-media/LINKEDIN_FOUNDER_INTERVIEW.md:199:When I'm explaining BuildOS to a friend, I say BuildOS is an AI-first project organization tool where you brain dump information and it organizes information for you. And then I talk about how like anything could be a project and you can just talk to it and it organizes it for you and the nice thing is that you can keep going back to this. So it's like any project that you're going to keep coming back to, you can just store in BuildLS as opposed to ChatGPT and you can just keep coming back to it and keep building on the last conversation or last place where you made progress. I sort of explain it that way. Words or phrases I use a lot. AI-first project organization, brain dump information, it's organized. I always say talk about context a lot and how you keep coming back to the same word or same project. That's one thing I talk about a lot. My sense of humor, I don't know, dude. Combination of things, kind of sometimes dark humor. Do I swear in professional context? I try not to swear in professional context.
