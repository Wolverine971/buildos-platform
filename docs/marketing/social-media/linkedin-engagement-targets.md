## Engagement Playbook

### Comment Templates by Situation

#### When someone posts about AI agents:

```
The agents conversation always comes back to context for me. These tools are impressive, but every new session starts from zero. Been thinking about this as "context engineering" vs "agent engineering" — what if the breakthrough is memory, not autonomy?
```

#### When someone complains about AI limitations:

```
This is the conversation I wish more people were having. The "smart but amnesiac AI" problem is real. I've been building in this space and context/memory feels like the unlock. What have you tried?
```

#### When someone shares productivity tips:

```
Love this. Something I've found works for my ADHD brain — [relevant tip]. The challenge is tools that assume neurotypical executive function. What's your take on designing for scattered minds?
```

#### When someone shares a founder journey:

```
Really appreciate the transparency here. Going through a similar inflection point with BuildOS — [parallel situation]. The [specific thing they mentioned] resonates. How did you ultimately decide?
```

#### When someone discusses context/memory in AI:

```
YES. This is exactly what I'm obsessed with right now. Building context infrastructure at BuildOS and this is the core bet — AI that knows your work beats generic AI every time. What solutions are you seeing emerge?
```

### Engagement Rules

1. **Timing:** Comment within 1 hour of posting for max visibility
2. **Length:** 2-4 sentences minimum — short comments get buried
3. **Value-add:** Never just agree — extend, question, or offer perspective
4. **Questions:** End with a question when natural — opens dialogue
5. **Authenticity:** Be yourself — LinkedIn users detect inauthenticity
6. **No pitching:** Only mention BuildOS if directly asked or highly relevant
7. **Follow-up:** Reply to anyone who engages with your comment

### Don't Do This

- "Great post!" or "Love this!" without adding value
- Tagging people who didn't engage with you
- Pitching BuildOS in every comment
- Copy-pasting the same comment
- Commenting just to be seen (no value)
- Arguing or being defensive
