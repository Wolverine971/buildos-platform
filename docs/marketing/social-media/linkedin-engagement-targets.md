## Engagement Playbook

### Comment Templates by Situation

#### When someone posts about AI agents:

```
What I keep coming back to: these agents are smart but stateless. Every new session starts from zero. I was connecting Uber/Lyft/DoorDash APIs at Curri before "AI tool use" was trendy — the insight was always about selecting the right tool for the context, not throwing everything at the problem. What if the breakthrough is memory, not autonomy?
```

#### When someone complains about AI limitations:

```
This is the conversation I wish more people were having. I kept pasting the same documents into ChatGPT, over and over. It knows things about me, but I don't know what it knows. Context/memory feels like the unlock. What have you tried?
```

#### When someone shares productivity tips:

```
What I'm finding is that clarity beats time management every time. Most productivity tools slow me down — spending all my time organizing instead of executing. What actually works is something that builds context over time instead of requiring constant maintenance.
```

#### When someone shares a founder journey:

```
Really appreciate the transparency here. Going through similar things with BuildOS — [parallel situation]. Speaking from experience, not authority — this stuff is too new for anyone to have the answers. How did you ultimately decide?
```

#### When someone discusses context/memory in AI:

```
This is exactly what I'm building toward. AI is already smart as fuck — but being smart is only one piece. You need frameworks, context. It's like JavaScript — you can code anything, but everyone uses React, Vue, Svelte. Same with AI. What solutions are you seeing?
```

#### When someone posts about PM/productivity tools:

```
This hits home. At my last job, my manager wanted Linear kept up to date. My reaction: "Just look at my pull requests." It was helping managers, not helping me. What I actually wanted was a thought partner that updates as I talk to it. How do you think about tools for makers vs managers?
```

### Engagement Rules

1. **Timing:** Comment within 1 hour of posting for max visibility
2. **Length:** 2-4 sentences minimum — short comments get buried
3. **Value-add:** Never just agree — extend, question, or offer perspective
4. **Questions:** End with a question when natural — opens dialogue
5. **Authenticity:** Be yourself — LinkedIn users detect inauthenticity
6. **No pitching:** Only mention BuildOS if directly asked or highly relevant
7. **Follow-up:** Reply to anyone who engages with your comment

### Don't Do This

- "Great post!" or "Love this!" without adding value
- Tagging people who didn't engage with you
- Pitching BuildOS in every comment
- Copy-pasting the same comment
- Commenting just to be seen (no value)
- Arguing or being defensive

---
