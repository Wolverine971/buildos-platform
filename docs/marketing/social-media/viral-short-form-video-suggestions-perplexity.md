To grab massive engagement for BuildOS, the short-form video concepts must empathize with overwhelm, visually dramatize internal chaos, and deliver instant, relatable “aha” moments that resonate with neurodivergent experiences. Here are fresh, scroll-stopping frameworks and examples tailored to ADHD minds and overwhelmed creators:

### Hook Frameworks That Resonate

- **The "Chaos-to-Clarity" Visual Jam:**  
  Start with rapid, glitchy jump-cuts showing scattered sticky notes, open browser tabs, flying planners, and anxious face close-ups. Smash-cut to BuildOS turning it all into one clear step—then zoom in on a relieved smile or a tiny win animation (“success unlocked!”). Caption: “ADHD brain? Watch chaos melt in 60 seconds.”

- **Relatable Skit or POV Story:**  
  POV: “When you try _another_ productivity app and forget about it in a week…” Quick cuts between failed attempts, planner graveyards, “Notion attempt #7,” then a punchy moment with BuildOS effortlessly clarifying one next task. End with a wink or meme: “This time, your brain will thank you.”

- **"Bad Brain Day = Tiny Win Day" Microchallenge:**  
  Jump-cut sequence of a real person stuck in bed, doomscrolling, voice-over saying “On a bad brain day, one tiny win is everything.” Show BuildOS prompting one doable action (ex: “Send that email”). Capture the moment of checking off the task, triggering a confetti or dopamine animation. Invite viewers to comment their tiny win.

### Why These Concepts Work

- They dramatize the overwhelm and failed systems with humor, memes, and authentic emotion, creating instant identification.
- Showing a tiny, achievable win (not perfection) brings dopamine hits and makes viewers feel “seen”.
- Quick, visually intense edits (glitch, jump cuts, confetti/dopamine animations) mirror the ADHD cognitive experience, grabbing attention fast.
- Inviting viewers to share their struggles and tiny wins boosts engagement and social proof.

- Use bold captions, progress bar animations, emoji, and interactive stickers.
- End every video with a prompt or quick poll (“duet this if you’ve abandoned Notion!”).

These frameworks are proven to connect with neurodivergent audiences craving real solutions, not perfect systems.
