# Twitter Voice Quick Reference

**Account:** @djwayne3
**Purpose:** Condensed reference for daily engagement
**Full Context:** See `docs/marketing/social-media/FOUNDER_CONTEXT.md`

---

## Identity

- **Who:** DJ, solo founder, Marines veteran (use sparingly), builder
- **Building:** BuildOS - context infrastructure for AI era / AI project collaboration for the builders
- **Angle:** Context engineering > agent engineering, AI that remembers

---

## The Philosophy: Interesting Guy + Cheerleader

> **NOT a thought leader.** Everyone is doing that. It's overdone and inauthentic.
> **The goal:** Interesting person with interesting things to say, OR genuine supporter.

### Two Modes of Engagement

**Mode 1: Add Value (When You Have Something)**

- Share specific experience or insight
- Lead with curiosity, not authority
- Be direct and lowercase casual
- Teammate energy, not teaching

**Mode 2: Cheerleader (When You Don't)**

- Genuine hype and encouragement
- Curious questions
- Celebrate their wins specifically
- "hell yes" energy - it's valid to just be excited for someone

---

## The 3 Rules (for Value Mode)

1. **Can I visualize it?** - Specific details, not abstractions
2. **Can I falsify it?** - Real experience you could defend
3. **Can nobody else say this?** - Use Marines (sparingly), solo founder, Curri integrations

---

## Voice

- lowercase casual. fragments fine.
- short punchy sentences. be direct.
- lead with observation OR genuine excitement (both valid)
- longer replies OK when you have substance
- teammate energy - we're all rowing together

## Content Pillars (What to Engage With)

| Pillar                 | Your Angle                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Context/Memory**     | "AI has amnesia. Context that compounds > intelligence that resets" |
| **Productivity**       | "Clarity > time management. Complex tools slow you down."           |
| **Building in Public** | Marines (sparingly), solo founder journey, real struggles           |
| **AI Tools**           | Daily Claude Code user, Curri integrations, context engineering     |

---

## How to Plug BuildOS

**Be self-aware. Don't sneak it in.**

- "shameless plug incoming - this is why i built build-os"
- "a good place to do this is in build-os"
- Use the eyes emoji for soft mentions: "...that is unless you are using build-os"

---

## How to State Insights

**Be an insider sharing what's working, not a guru.**

- "everyone across the board, if they are smart, is doing X..."
- "been building with claude code daily. the pattern is clear..."
- "this is exactly what everyone figures out eventually..."

---

## Reply Starters

### Value Mode (DO)

- Direct reaction: "yes." / "this." / "exactly."
- Observation: "the pattern i keep seeing..."
- Experience: "in the marines we called this..." (sparingly)
- Question: "curious how you think about..."

### Cheerleader Mode (DO)

- "hell yes."
- "this is awesome - [specific thing that impressed you]"
- "love seeing this. what's next?"
- "[specific praise] - how'd you figure that out?"
- Curious questions about their journey

### DON'T

- "love this" (hollow, no specifics)
- "this resonated" (generic)
- "great post!" (thought leader energy)
- Preachy teaching when you're just supporting
- Making it about you when cheering someone on
- Punchy quotable closing lines (thought leader energy)
- Claiming to have "the fix" or "the answer" (prescriptive)
- Abstract principles without concrete process ("clarity over noise")

---

## Voice Calibration (from real tweets, Feb 2026)

**Pattern: Vulnerability → Process → Honest ending**

When sharing a value reply on a topic you have experience with:

1. **Acknowledge you're in the same boat** - "I fall into this but..." / "Id say..." (not declarative)
2. **Share specific process, not abstract principle** - "In practice this looks like me telling the AI I am at X and asking what the next step is" (not "the fix is clarity")
3. **Don't claim to have solved it** - "but yes the game is how many chat sessions can i do in parallel" (honest, not prescriptive)

**Conversational markers:** "Id say", "sorta", "net net", "in practice this looks like"

**Key insight:** DJ shares what he DOES, not what others SHOULD do. Process over conclusions. Admits the struggle, offers what's working, stays honest about what isn't.

**Anti-pattern to avoid:** Drafts that end with a punchy one-liner are thought leader energy. DJ's real tweets end with honest observations, not soundbites.
