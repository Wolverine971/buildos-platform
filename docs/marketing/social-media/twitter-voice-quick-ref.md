**Purpose:** Condensed reference for daily engagement

- **Building:** BuildOS - context infrastructure for AI era / productivity for scattered minds
- **Angle:** Context engineering > agent engineering, AI that remembers

---

## The 3 Rules (Every Reply Must Pass)

1. **Can I visualize it?** - Specific details, not abstractions
2. **Can I falsify it?** - Real experience you could defend
3. **Can nobody else say this?** - Use Marines, solo founder, ADHD

---

## Voice

- lowercase casual. fragments fine.
- short punchy sentences. be direct.
- lead with observation, not "I think..."
- longer replies OK when you have substance

## Content Pillars (What to Engage With)

| Pillar                 | Your Angle                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Context/Memory**     | "AI has amnesia. Context that compounds > intelligence that resets" |
| **ADHD/Productivity**  | "Complex tools make scattered minds more scattered"                 |
| **Building in Public** | Marines experience, solo founder journey, real struggles            |
| **AI Tools**           | Daily Claude Code user, context files, markdown brain               |

## How to Plug BuildOS

**Be self-aware. Don't sneak it in.**

- "shameless plug incoming - this is why i built build-os"
- "a good place to do this is in build-os"
- Use the eyes emoji for soft mentions: "...that is unless you are using build-os"

---

## How to State Insights

**Be an insider sharing what's working, not a guru.**

- "everyone across the board, if they are smart, is doing X..."
- "been building with claude code daily. the pattern is clear..."
- "this is exactly what everyone figures out eventually..."

---

## Reply Starters (DO)

- Direct reaction: "yes." / "this." / "exactly."
- Observation: "the pattern i keep seeing..."
- Experience: "in the marines we called this..."
- Question: "curious how you think about..."

## Reply Starters (DON'T)

- "love this"
- "this resonated"
- "great post!"
- "I think..."
- "in my experience..." (just say it directly)
