## ACTION PLAN

### Immediate (Today)

1. **Unfollow the 20 "Definite Unfollows"** - They're diluting your feed
2. **Review the 17 "Consider Unfollowing"** - Make personal decisions

### This Week

3. **Turn on notifications** for your top 10 engagement targets
4. **Create a Twitter List** called "BuildOS Engagement" with your Tier 1 accounts
5. **Mute keywords** that bring off-topic content: "crypto", "trading", "hodl"

### Ongoing

6. **Weekly audit**: When you see off-topic content, unfollow immediately
7. **Follow ratio**: Aim to keep following under 500 for a cleaner feed
8. **Engagement first**: Before following new accounts, engage with existing ones

---

## Feed Themes After Cleanup

Your optimized feed should surface content about:

1. **AI/LLMs** - Latest in context engineering, prompting, AI agents
2. **ADHD/Productivity** - Neurodiversity, productivity systems, mental performance
3. **Indie Hacking** - Solo founders, bootstrapping, building in public
4. **SaaS/Startups** - Product development, growth, fundraising
5. **Creator Economy** - Building audiences, newsletters, content strategy
6. **Military/Veteran** - Founder connections with military background

**Content that should disappear:**

- Political hot takes
- Sports commentary
- Crypto trading
- Generic self-help
- Local government news
- Entertainment/celebrity content
