# Peer Cohort - Twitter Engagement Database

> **Purpose:** Accounts at a similar level to @djwayne3 for mutual engagement, community building, and cohort growth.
> **Your Stats:** @djwayne3 = **262 followers** (as of 2026-01-13)
> **Target Range:** 100-3,000 followers (true peers - accounts 0.5x to 10x your size)
> **Last Updated:** 2026-01-13
> **Audit Status:** COMPLETE - All accounts Chrome browser verified

**Related Docs:**

- **[Main Profile Index](../INDEX.md)** - Larger accounts for aspirational engagement (5K+)
- **[Accounts Tracker](../../twitter-accounts-tracker.md)** - Live tracking with last visited dates
- **[Founder Context](../../FOUNDER_CONTEXT.md)** - DJ's voice and positioning

---

## IMPORTANT: What "Peer" Actually Means

With **262 followers**, your true peers are accounts in the **100-3,000 range**. The previous version of this document incorrectly included many accounts 10x-1500x your size.

**These are NOT peers** - they're aspirational targets. Your replies to them get buried. True peer engagement creates mutual growth.

## Strategy: Why TRUE Peer Cohorts Matter

Building relationships with accounts **at your actual level** creates:

1. **Mutual Visibility** - Your replies don't get buried under 100 others
2. **Reciprocal Engagement** - They notice you, you notice them
3. **Authentic Community** - Same stage, same struggles, same wins
4. **Algorithm Boost** - Early engagement from 20 peers beats 1 like from a 100K account
5. **Future Network** - Today's 200-follower peer is next year's 10K success story

**The Math:**

- Replying to @karpathy (1.5M): Your reply is #847 of 1000. Nobody sees it.
- Replying to @jim_stef (124): Your reply might be 1 of 5. You're visible.

---

## Engagement Strategy for True Peers

### Daily Routine (10-15 min)

1. **Check 5-10 Tier A/B accounts** - fresh posts from last 24h
2. **Leave substantive comments** - not "great post!" but real thoughts
3. **DM congratulations** for milestones (optional, don't overdo)
4. **Quote tweet their wins** - add your perspective

### Engagement Templates

**For their launches:**

```
hell yes. shipping [specific thing] is no joke. what was the hardest part?
```

**For their struggles:**

```
been there. [specific relatable detail]. what would help most right now?
```

**For their wins:**

```
[specific metric] in [timeframe]? that's real. what's working best?
```

### Weekly Goals

- [ ] Engage with 15+ peer posts (Tier A/B priority)
- [ ] Have 2+ genuine back-and-forth conversations
- [ ] DM 1-2 peers with genuine compliments
- [ ] Quote tweet 1 peer win with your take

---

## Finding New Peers

Search for accounts building similar things with similar follower counts:

**Twitter Search Queries:**

- `"building in public" filter:follows_you` (find mutual follows)
- `"solo founder" "AI" min_faves:5 max_faves:50` (find smaller accounts)
- `"ADHD" "productivity" "building"` (find your niche)
- `#buildinpublic min_followers:100 max_followers:2000`

**Good peer indicators:**

- 100-3,000 followers
- Posts regularly about building
- Engages with others (not just broadcasts)
- Similar niche (AI, productivity, ADHD, SaaS)

---

## Data Accuracy Notes

- **VERIFIED accounts** (bold followers) were checked via Chrome browser on 2026-01-13
- **Update this file** when you discover significant changes
- **Remove inactive accounts** (no posts in 60+ days)
