# Charly Wargnier (@DataChaz)

## Bio

> Ex @Streamlit @Snowflake Maestro 🪄 • X about AI agents, LLMs, web apps, Python & SEO • My ❤️ is open source

**Category:** Community
**Location:** London 🇬🇧 ⇆ 🇫🇷 Pyrenees
**Website:** [charlywargnier.com](https://charlywargnier.com)

## 🚨 WHY THIS ACCOUNT IS CRITICAL

**DataChaz is one of the most prolific Claude Code pattern sharers.** His pinned thread covers:

1. **Error Logging System** - Reconstructing the input-output loop that agentic coding hides
2. **/Commands as Lightweight Local Apps** - "Slash commands are secretly one of the most powerful parts of Claude Code. I think of them as Claude as a Service"
3. **Hooks for Deterministic Safety** - dangerously-skip-permissions + hooks for safe actions
4. **Context Hygiene** - Status lines, context compaction, "double-escape time travel"
5. **Subagent Control** - Claude Code spawning Sonnet/Haiku subagents
6. **The Reprompteur System** - Voice dictation → clarifying questions → structured prompt

Has a **16-page Google Doc** with detailed tips, slash commands, and subagent monitoring dashboard.
