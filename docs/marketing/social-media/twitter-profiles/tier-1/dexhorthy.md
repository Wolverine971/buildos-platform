# Dex Horthy (@dexhorthy)

## Bio

> building the post-IDE IDE at hlyr.dev/code - @aitinkerers sf organizer, prev @replicatedhq @SproutSocial - ai that works pod @ hlyr.dev/aitw

**Location:** San Francisco, CA
**Website:** [hlyr.dev/code](https://hlyr.dev/code)
**Podcast:** [hlyr.dev/aitw](https://hlyr.dev/aitw) (AI That Works)

## 🚨 WHY THIS ACCOUNT IS CRITICAL

**Dex coined "Context Engineering"** - the EXACT terminology and philosophy behind BuildOS.

swyx credits him with "capturing the zeitgeist of some of the most important problems in AI Engineering today."

## Key Contributions

1. **Coined "Context Engineering"** - The term that defines BuildOS positioning
2. **12-Factor Agents Manifesto** - Patterns for reliable LLM applications
3. **Harness Engineering** - How you use existing agents (commands, hooks, skills, MCPs)
4. **"Most agent failures are context failures"** - Validates BuildOS thesis

## Current Projects

- **hlyr.dev/code** - "Post-IDE IDE" (AI-native development environment)
- **AI Tinkerers SF** - Organizer
- **AI That Works Podcast** - hlyr.dev/aitw
- Previously: @replicatedhq, @SproutSocial

## Content Themes

- **Context Engineering:** Original framing, patterns, philosophy
- **Coding Agents:** How to get the most out of AI coding assistants
- **Agent Architecture:** 12-Factor Agents framework
- **Harness Engineering:** Customizing agent behavior with context

## His Core Philosophy (BuildOS Alignment)

> "The main thing that determines whether an Agent succeeds or fails is the quality of the context you give it. Most agent failures are not model failures anymore - they are context failures."

This IS the BuildOS thesis.

## Pinned Content

- **Dec 8, 2025:** Superthread on coding agents, context engineering, research/plan/implement patterns

## January 2026 Update

- **Growth:** 3.2K → 10.5K followers (3x growth in weeks) - context engineering term is gaining traction
- **Jan 9:** Posted "So much 'I spent $$ tokens' so little 'I shipped $$ value'" - builder vs experimenter angle
- Continued evolution of "harness engineering" concept

## Engagement Strategy

- **Mode:** Add Value (deep engagement, reference his frameworks)
- **Best Topics:** Context engineering in practice, Claude Code, BuildOS approach
- **Critical:** Study his 12-Factor Agents and Harness Engineering concepts
- **Note:** Smaller following (10K) = higher engagement potential
