# LinkedIn Voice Quick Reference

**Purpose:** Condensed reference for daily LinkedIn engagement
**Full Context:** See `docs/marketing/social-media/FOUNDER_CONTEXT.md`

---

## Identity

- **Who:** DJ, solo founder, Marines veteran (use sparingly), builder
- **Building:** BuildOS - context infrastructure for the AI era / AI-first project organization
- **Angle:** Context engineering > agent engineering, AI that remembers

---

## Voice (LinkedIn-Specific)

- Professional but authentic - not corporate
- Learning voice, not authoritative: "What I'm finding..." not "The answer is..."
- Longer, more nuanced than Twitter (2-4 sentence comments minimum)
- Direct, no bullshit - but professional
- Hates inauthenticity - especially LinkedIn thought leader types

### DO

- Lead with observation or insight
- Be specific - use real examples from your experience
- Ask thoughtful questions to open dialogue
- "What I'm finding..." / "In my experience building..."
- Reference their past content when engaging big accounts

### DON'T

- "Love this!" / "Great post!" / "This resonated"
- Generic observations anyone could make
- Preachy setups ("Most people don't realize...")
- Sycophantic praise
- "I think..." (just say it directly)

## Content Pillars (What to Engage With)

| Pillar                  | Your Angle                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Context Engineering** | "AI has amnesia. Context that compounds > intelligence that resets" |
| **Building in Public**  | Solo founder, learning voice, the grind, what's working/not         |
| **AI + Productivity**   | Clarity > time management. Context > prompts.                       |
| **Contrarian Takes**    | Blue collar software engineering. PM tools for managers not makers. |

## Key Stories to Reference

| Story                          | When to Use                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Curri Linear frustration**   | PM tools, thought partner, maker vs manager      |
| **Curri integrations**         | Tool use credibility, "before AI made it trendy" |
| **Pasting docs into ChatGPT**  | Context problem, AI memory                       |
| **Obsidian stale notes**       | Second brain graveyard, tool frustration         |
| **Brain dump → agentic pivot** | Building in public, what I was wrong about       |
| **Marines** (sparingly)        | Background color, not headline                   |

## How to Plug BuildOS

**Be transparent. Don't sneak it in.**

- "I'm building BuildOS to solve this exact problem..."
- "This is what I'm trying to address with BuildOS..."
- Only mention when genuinely relevant to the conversation
- Learning voice: "What I'm finding as I build..."

---

## Comment Starters

**Good:**

- "What I'm finding as I build in this space..."
- "I hit this same wall when..."
- "The pattern I keep seeing..."
- "Curious how you think about..."
- "This connects to something I've been wrestling with..."

**Bad:**

- "Love this!"
- "Great post!"
- "This resonated with me"
- "I think..." (just say it directly)
- "Most people don't realize..." (preachy)
