## 📋 Engagement Playbook

### Reply Templates by Pillar

#### Context Engineering Angle

> "this is actually a context problem. [tool/AI] forgets because it has no persistent memory. the future isn't smarter AI, it's AI that remembers."

#### ADHD/Productivity Angle

> "this hits different for scattered minds. complex tools make us more scattered. simple + consistent > complex + abandoned."

#### Building in Public Angle

> "going through this exact thing building build-os. [share relevant struggle/insight]"

#### AI Memory Pain Point

> "everyone's building smarter models. but smarter doesn't help if it forgets everything between conversations. context that compounds > intelligence that resets."

### Engagement Rules

1. **Be first** - Reply within 30 mins of post for max visibility
2. **Add value** - Don't just agree, extend the thought
3. **Be human** - Use your real experiences (Marines, ADHD, solo founder)
4. **No hard sell** - BuildOS mention only when genuinely relevant
5. **Ask questions** - Opens conversation threads
6. **Reference their content** - Show you actually follow them

### Voice Reminders

- lowercase casual. fragments fine.
- lead with observation, not "I think..."
- be direct. cut filler words.
- no "love this" or "great post"
- use "shameless plug" framing when mentioning BuildOS
