## 1. Lenny Rachitsky - Leadership & Scaling

**Post Link:** [https://x.com/lennysan/status/2007853455570829588](https://x.com/lennysan/status/2007853455570829588)

**The Tweet:**

> "I like being scared"
>
> Molly Graham (@molly_g) has worked for some of tech's most effective leaders, including @finkd, @chamath, @sherylsandberg, and @btaylor. She's best known for her "Give away your Legos" framework and her collection of practical mental models for leading through hypergrowth.
>
> In our conversation, we dig into:
>
> - Why the best careers look like J-curves, not stairs
> - "The waterline model" for diagnosing team problems
> - "Give away your Legos": her framework for scaling yourself as a leader
> - Six rules for creating effective goals
> - Three rules of thumb for leading through rapid scale

**✅ What I Posted:**

> molly graham's "give away your legos" isn't really about legos. it's about giving away creative control.

> you pour care into building something and hope the next person treats it the same way.

> this is why i trust AI as my first hire. it reads the docs. follows my examples. doesn't bring ego.

> everyone writing context files and SOPs for claude code right now? you're building the playbook for the most coachable teammate you'll ever have.

## 2. Shaan Puri - Getting Great at Something

**Post Link:** [https://x.com/ShaanVP/status/2008221648621813827](https://x.com/ShaanVP/status/2008221648621813827)

**The Tweet:**

> if you're in your 20s, and want to get great at something - just do 1 thing:
>
> go live in a house with 5-7 other people equally obsessed about that thing
>
> That's it. that's the whole strategy
>
> eat, sleep, talk non-stop with other obsessed people.
>
> It's an avalanche of progress

**✅ What I Posted:**

> yes.

> it's great because you're building shared context.

> after the first few days you settle in, the rhythms start, and the shared experience compounds.

> i look back on my time in the marines and those times were the best even though in the moment we were all in the suck.

> that context sticks with you long after. the lingo, the crazy PT, the late night haircuts, the ungentlemanly leaders, the degenerate late nights, the silver bullets. it's all bonding and learning.

> other people won't get it because they weren't there. they don't have the context.

> if only i could be back with the bois.

## 3. Dan Shipper - 2026 AI Strategy

**Post Link:** [https://x.com/danshipper/status/2008307698731974828](https://x.com/danshipper/status/2008307698731974828)

**The Tweet:**

> I just showed the team our 2026 roadmap. I got so psyched that I wanted to share it with you too.
>
> Here's our full 2026 strategy.
>
> [Video: "The only subscription you need to stay at the edge of AI"]

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Context Question):**

> your "allocation economy" piece has been living in my head. curious how you're thinking about context/memory in AI workflows—feels like the next unlock after we solve the raw intelligence problem.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Building in Public):**

> this level of transparency is rare. most founders treat their roadmap like a state secret.

> reality: execution > ideas. sharing builds trust.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Direct Question):**

> what's the one bet you're most nervous about for 2026?

## 4. Min Choi - AI Getting Out of Hand

**Post Link:** [https://x.com/minchoi/status/2008272843193434203](https://x.com/minchoi/status/2008272843193434203)

**The Tweet:**

> AI is getting out of hand 😂
>
> [Video: AI-animated Mona Lisa]

**✅ What I Posted:**

> meanwhile most people are spending 10 minutes re-explaining ideas to chatgpt for the 5th time.

> AI can make mona lisa dance but can't remember we had this exact conversation yesterday. that is unless you are using build-os 👀

> the demos are wild. the daily experience is groundhog day for most people not using build-os or something similar.

## Reply Guidelines (DJ Voice)

### The 3 Rules (Every Reply Must Pass)

1. **Can I visualize it?** — Use specific details, not abstract concepts. "the crazy PT, the late night haircuts, the silver bullets" > "shared experiences"
2. **Can I falsify it?** — Is this your real experience? Could you defend it if challenged?
3. **Can nobody else say this?** — If anyone could tweet this, it's not worth posting. Your marines background, your solo founder journey, your ADHD brain—use them.

### Voice Principles

- Lowercase casual. perfect grammar not required.
- Short punchy sentences. fragments fine.
- Start with observation or reaction, not "I think..."
- Be direct. cut filler words.
- If you'd cringe reading it out loud, rewrite it.
- Longer replies are fine when you have real substance (see Shaan response)

### DO

- Lead with insight, not agreement
- Reference your specific experience (marines, building, ADHD)
- Get visual and specific—details make it real
- Plug BuildOS when it's genuinely relevant (use 👀 for soft mentions)
- Frame problems as "most people" experiencing what you've solved
- End with something human ("if only i could be back with the bois")

### DON'T

- Copy-paste—these are starting points, personalize
- Reply to all 5 at once (looks spammy)
- Just say "great post!" or generic praise
- Open with "love this" or "this resonated"
- Be generic—if anyone could say it, don't say it
- Sound like AI wrote it
