# LinkedIn Search & Discovery Strategy

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-06
**Purpose:** Find people discussing topics relevant to BuildOS to engage with

---

## How LinkedIn Search Works

Unlike Twitter, LinkedIn doesn't have advanced boolean search for posts. Instead:

1. **Use the search bar** → Filter by "Posts" → Sort by "Latest"
2. **Hashtag search** → Click on hashtags to see recent posts
3. **Content filters** → Filter by date, author connections, etc.
4. **Feed algorithm** → Your engagement shapes what you see
5. **Creator mode** → Follow specific topics to populate feed

### Search Limitations

- No complex boolean operators
- Can't filter by engagement level
- Limited to recent posts (not historical)
- Results heavily influenced by your network

### Workaround Strategies

1. **Follow topics** in creator mode to populate feed
2. **Follow hashtags** for topic-specific content
3. **Use Google site search**: `site:linkedin.com/posts "your search term"`
4. **Build feed through engagement** — comment on relevant posts to train algorithm

## Google Site Search (Advanced)

For more precise searching, use Google:

### Search Patterns

```
site:linkedin.com/posts "context engineering"
```

```
site:linkedin.com/posts "AI memory" problem
```

```
site:linkedin.com/posts "ChatGPT" frustrated
```

```
site:linkedin.com/posts "productivity app" gave up
```

```
site:linkedin.com/posts "ADHD" productivity
```

```
site:linkedin.com/posts "AI agents" limitation
```

### With Time Filter

Add `after:2025-01-01` for recent posts:

```
site:linkedin.com/posts "context engineering" after:2025-12-01
```

### With Author Filter (if you know the person)

```
site:linkedin.com/posts "Ethan Mollick" AI productivity
```

- High-volume low-value posters

**Engage strategically:**

- Spend time on (read fully) posts about AI, productivity, building
- Comment on your target topics
- Like/save posts you want more of

## Content Discovery Routine

1. **Check feed** — Engage with 2-3 relevant posts
2. **One hashtag** — Search, engage with 1-2 posts
3. **Notifications** — Respond to any engagement

### Weekly (30 minutes)

1. **Topic searches** — Run 3-5 searches, save interesting accounts

3. **Update targets** — Add new people to engagement targets doc
4. **Topic trends** — What's hot? Adjust search queries

## Engagement Priorities by Search Result

### High Priority (Comment immediately)

- Posts with < 10 comments (room to be noticed)
- Posts from accounts with 5k-50k followers (engaged but not overwhelmed)
- Posts asking questions (easy to add value)
- Posts expressing frustration (empathy opportunity)
- Posts about context/memory in AI (your expertise)

### Medium Priority (Comment if time)

- Posts with 10-30 comments (still visible, more competition)
- Posts from large accounts (visibility but harder to stand out)
- Posts sharing advice (add your perspective)

### Low Priority (Skip)

- Posts with 50+ comments (you'll be buried)
- Posts from celebrities/mega-influencers (too much noise)
- Posts that are just promotional (no real discussion)
- Posts with no engagement after 24 hours (algorithm didn't favor)
