## Tailored Outreach Game Plans

Key principles across all:

- **Personalize heavily**: Reference a recent post/podcast/episode + their pain point (e.g., scattered thoughts, team org).
- **Multi-channel**: Start with DM/Twitter (highest response for creators), fallback to email/LinkedIn/podcast forms.
- **Pitch structure**: 1) Compliment specific work, 2) Quick BuildOS value prop ("AI-first tool that parses brain dumps into projects/tasks/goals"), 3) Tailored hook + ask (chat/demo/insights), 4) Short CTA.
- **Timing**: Weekdays 9-11AM their TZ; follow up 7-10 days later.
- **Track in BuildOS**: Log outreaches as `task.coordinate.outreach` under the related plan (ed945d56-8ec1-4c30-bcad-073692273976).
