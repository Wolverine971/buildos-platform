## Background & Origin Story

### Military Background (Use Sparingly - "A Nice Little Treat")

- **Marine Corps**: 2012-2017 (5 years)
- **Path**: Infantry (3/11) → Scout Sniper (3/17) → Tried out for MARSOC (didn't get selected) → Got out to become entrepreneur
- **Key Lessons That Apply to Building**:
    - Five-paragraph order planning (reconnaissance requires heavy planning)
    - Long-range precision shooting requires detail, methodical approach
    - Stalking requires patience and concentration
    - Concentration for long periods → translates to programming
- **How to Use**: Mention occasionally as background color, not the main identity. "Nice little treat" not the headline.

### Path to Tech

- Read Tim Ferriss: "If you want to succeed as entrepreneur, you need to be technical or you're at the mercy of whoever is technical"
- **Sabio Coding Bootcamp** (LA) - founder was old Myspace guy
- Fun fact: Failed a programming class in community college before Marines, but bootcamp clicked
- Hired at Sabio after bootcamp, then moved back to East Coast

### Career Timeline

| When             | Where                 | What                                                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2012-2017        | USMC                  | Infantry → Scout Sniper → MARSOC tryout                                 |
| Post-bootcamp    | Sabio                 | Hired on after graduating                                               |
| Next             | Census Bureau         | Making Census data accessible                                           |
| Next             | [Company]             | Platform for Marine Corps lawyers to search cases                       |
| Next             | [Company]             | Intelligence document ingest system for Air Force (before AI did this!) |
| ~2023-March 2025 | **Curri** (YC-backed) | Delivery logistics - see details below                                  |
| May 2025         | **BuildOS**           | Started building                                                        |

### Curri Experience (Highly Relevant)

**What Curri Does**: YC-backed delivery logistics company

**What DJ Built**:

1. **Exception System**: Changed from dispatchers monitoring deliveries to proactively pinging them via queue system when issues arise. "They can chill and then get pinged when they need to do something."

2. **Integrations Guy** (Most Relevant to BuildOS):
    - Hooked up Uber's API for when small packages couldn't find drivers in network
    - Algorithm searched drivers based on: search radius, price, time spent searching
    - If criteria not met → fall back to Uber
    - Then expanded to: Lyft, DoorDash, other delivery providers
    - "API reverse engineering stuff" - hacking integrations together
    - **This directly translates to connecting tools to BuildOS AI agent**
    - Has been solving "how do you connect systems intelligently" before AI made it trendy

3. Map visualization features

**Key Frustration at Curri** (Content Gold):

- Manager wanted Linear kept up to date with progress
- DJ's reaction: "Just look at my pull requests. This is such a hassle."
- Linear was extra task that didn't help him, only helped managers
- **Would rather have a thought partner like BuildOS that updates as you talk to it**
- "I don't think it helped me with my project at all. It was only for managers."

### Side Projects (Shows Pattern of Building)

| Project                   | What                                  | Status            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Ninetakes**             | Enneagram-based Reddit                | Built on the side |
| **Cadre Training**        | Site for scout sniper buddy           | Built for friend  |
| **Tiny Tribe Adventures** | Map-based family day trip suggestions | Built with friend |

## BuildOS Journey

### Origin Frustration

The real "fuck this" moment:

- Having a bunch of chats on random topics
- Never going back to those chats
- ChatGPT knows about him but he doesn't know what it knows
- Wanted transparency: "What does it know about me? Let me fill in the gaps"
- Kept pasting documents into chats: "I want a system that knows where to look"

### Tools Tried Before

| Tool        | Problem                                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Notion      | Too complicated                                                            |
| Obsidian    | Static, high maintenance to organize (still has tons of stale notes there) |
| Apple Notes | Tons of notes, no organization                                             |
| Moleskines  | Physical, no AI                                                            |

Core frustration: "I wanted a thing I could just talk to, and it understands where I'm coming from."

### Product Evolution

**First Version** (May 2025):

- Projects and life goals → simplified to just "projects" (a life goal is a project)
- Project = grouping of information surrounded by an end state (point A → point B)
- Had tasks, calendar events, brain dumping

**Key Pivots**:

1. Brain dumping is great, but **agent should talk back** - "the agent knows shit too"
2. Not just projects/tasks/calendars → projects with **defined goals, documents, milestones, plans**
3. System should help you get to end state: "Here's the end goal, here are milestones, here's the plan, here are tasks. Go step by step."

**What Flopped**: Just simple projects and tasks. Need more dynamic thing.

**Vision**: "Become the Palantir of projects" - develop an ontology so BuildOS can handle any project and gracefully organize data.

### Features Proud Of

1. **Agentic chat** - "just chat with the OS, it understands the tools"
2. **Ontology and graph view** - "we think in terms of goals and tasks"

### Current State (As of Jan 2026)

- ~70 signups, no active users yet
- Few beta users
- **Hardest problem**: Making it as good as ChatGPT + figuring out marketing
- **What keeps him up**: "Is it solving a real problem? It's solving it for me, but explaining to others is hard. Differentiating from ChatGPT/Claude is hard."
- **What he loves**: "It's building context. That part is really powerful."

## Core Beliefs & Hot Takes

### On Productivity

> "People are already doing their best. They just need more clarity to be more productive. You're not going to be more productive by budgeting time."

> "It's not about managing your time, it's about clarity. If you get people thinking clearly, they'll be more productive."

> "Most productivity tools and project management apps slow you down because you spend all your time organizing information and not executing."

### On AI

> "AI is already smart as fuck. But being smart is only one piece of the puzzle. You need to give it frameworks."

> "It's like JavaScript - you can code anything with it, but everyone uses React, Vue, Svelte. These frameworks help you get there faster. Same with AI - it knows everything, but you need a framework + context for it to give you actionable information."

> "Context engineering = the information relevant to the task at hand. How do you pull in relevant information strategically? With all data possible, what's relevant to what you're trying to do?"

> "If you want the AI agent to be good, you've got to give it the right context. That's the core insight."

### On Building AI Products

> "People are focused on tools, but should be focused on building context about the user and their goals."

> "MCPs and tool use - you're not just going to throw all the tools at AI and it's going to do a great job. You need to give it the specific tools for the job. Otherwise, the rest is noise."

### On Startups

> "I like the idea of one strong leader driving the boat. Steve Jobs. Brian Chesky's founder mode. As a solo founder, I can get a lot of shit done because I'm steering the boat."

> "You can't just bring in smart people and let them do stuff. You need very specific goals. You need alignment."

### On Data & Measurement

> "Not all that gets measured counts, and not all that counts gets measured. Data can be used to skew the truth rather than reveal it."

## Things That Annoy Him

### AI Space

- **MCPs and tool use hype** - throwing all tools at AI doesn't work, need specific tools

### Productivity Culture

- Packed calendars
- Meetings back to back

### LinkedIn

- "Everyone's trying to be a thought leader and just be so inauthentic and not real"

---

## How His Brain Works

### Personality (Enneagram 8 - Don't Mention Publicly)

- Action-oriented
- Gets restless
- Annoyed at slow progress
- Contrarian thinker: "What do I know that most people don't? What are people missing? What's the opposite point of view?"
- Likes to stress test ideas

### Work Style

- Act-first, ask-questions-later
- Good at prototyping, diving in, figuring it out
- Can grind for long coding stints
- Working on: stepping back for big picture (tends to want to move fast)

### Good Day vs Bad Day

- **Good day**: Wake up early, get good chunk done in morning, keep doing stuff
- **Bad day**: Worked a lot but didn't accomplish much
- Currently reliant on energy drinks and coffee

---

## AI Usage

### Tools He Uses

- ChatGPT
- Claude Code
- OpenAI Codex
- Claude and ChatGPT for random browser chats
- **BuildOS** when he has a project (storing all his info there)

### Frustrating AI Experience

- When AI mentions something from previous chat that you didn't know it knew
- Wants transparency: "I'd rather it be transparent about what it knows about me and what it doesn't"

### What He Wishes AI Could Do

- Be more proactive
- "That's what I'm trying to get BuildOS to do - it has all this context on me, now go proactively do stuff"

## Unique Differentiators for LinkedIn

### What Makes DJ Different

1. **Integration experience before AI**: Built Uber/Lyft/DoorDash integrations at Curri - has been solving "connect systems intelligently" for years, now doing it with AI

2. **Military background** (use sparingly): Scout sniper → methodical, detail-oriented, can concentrate for long periods

3. **Built document ingest system for Air Force before AI**: Was solving the "make documents searchable" problem before LLMs

4. **Solo founder shipping fast**: Action-oriented Enneagram 8 who prototypes and iterates

5. **Contrarian thinker**: Naturally asks "what's the opposite view?" and stress tests ideas

6. **Eating own dogfood**: Actually uses BuildOS for his projects, not just building it

### The Curri → BuildOS Connection

The integration work at Curri (connecting Uber, Lyft, DoorDash APIs based on intelligent criteria) is essentially what he's now doing with AI tools at BuildOS. He's been doing "agentic tool use" before it was called that.

## Content Angles to Use

### From His Experience

1. **Linear frustration** → "Project management tools are for managers, not makers"
2. **Pasting documents into ChatGPT** → "The context problem nobody talks about"
3. **Curri integrations** → "I was doing 'tool use' before AI made it trendy"
4. **Context transparency** → "AI knows things about you that you don't know it knows"
5. **Obsidian stale notes** → "Your second brain is a graveyard"

### His Natural Voice

- Direct, no bullshit
- Contrarian but not cynical
- Action-oriented
- Comfortable with uncertainty
- Will say "shit" and "fuck" when appropriate
- Hates inauthenticity
