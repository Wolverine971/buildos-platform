# DJ's Life Story Interview

> **Purpose:** Capture your complete life narrative in a structured format. This isn't about going deep on any one topic (that's the Round 2 Deep-Dive) - this is about capturing the arc of your life from beginning to now.
>
> **Why This Matters:** Your life story is what makes you interesting. Not your takes on AI or productivity - those are outputs. The story is the input. When you engage on social media as an "interesting guy," you're drawing on this reservoir of lived experience.
>
> **Format:** Answer each chapter in 2-5 paragraphs. Write like you're telling a story to a friend over drinks. Don't worry about being polished.

## After You Complete This

This life story will be used to:

1. **Enrich the FOUNDER_CONTEXT.md** - Add the narrative depth that makes engagement authentic
2. **Create the "interesting guy" foundation** - Your story is what makes you worth following
3. **Inform the cheerleader energy** - Understanding your journey helps you genuinely connect with others on theirs
4. **Generate authentic content** - Real stories from real experiences

The goal is that when you engage on LinkedIn or Twitter, you're not performing as "BuildOS Founder" - you're showing up as DJ, who has lived a full life and happens to be building something.
