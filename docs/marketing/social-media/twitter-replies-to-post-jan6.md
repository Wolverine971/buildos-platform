**The Tweet:**

> It's ok to want to impress other people, but choose the right people

**Stats:** 26 replies, 102 likes (1h ago - FRESH)

**Suggested Reply Option 1:**

> spent years trying to impress VCs and "serious" tech people. built complex stuff that looked impressive but didn't actually help anyone.
>
> now i build for scattered ADHD brains like mine. way smaller audience. way more useful product. way happier life.

**Suggested Reply Option 2:**

> the audience you optimize for becomes the product you build.
>
> optimize for investors? you build pitch deck features. optimize for users with real problems? you build stuff that actually works.
>
> took me way too long to figure this out.

**Suggested Reply Option 3:**

> real talk: i used to build features to impress people who would never use the product.
>
> now i only care what scattered minds think. they're the ones who actually need this stuff to work.

## 2. Lenny Rachitsky - AI Agents Need Product Agents

**Post Link:** [https://x.com/lennysan](https://x.com/lennysan) (check 27m ago post - quote of Jordan Singer)

**The Tweet:**

> First they came for CX, and I said nothing...

Quoting Jordan Singer's article: "Coding agents need product agents"

> "Coding is getting cheap. Decision-making is still expensive. Coding agents have collapsed the cost of implementation. Shipping is accelerating..."

**Stats:** 4 replies, 10 likes (27m ago - VERY FRESH)

**✅ POSTED:**

> Decision making is still expensive because ai agents dont have all the context to make the right decisions.
>
> Async is slurping up all that yummy slack context which makes it smart and useful.
>
> This is why everyone across the board, if they are smart is creating context by creating a ton of markdown files that contain SOPs, brand strategy, values, goals, workflow examples etc..
>
> **shameless plug incoming**
>
> If you aren't already doing this, start.
>
> Start braindumping context so the agents can make good decisions.
>
> And a good place to do this is in build-os 😉

## 3. Shaan Puri - 3 Ways To Hijack Your Creative Brain

**Post Link:** [https://x.com/ShaanVP/status/2007909912723018067](https://x.com/ShaanVP/status/2007909912723018067)

**The Tweet:**

> 3 ways to hijack the creative part of your brain:
>
> 1. Morning Mud - "You will only be as great as you're willing to be bad." Seinfeld wrote bad jokes for 2 hours every morning. Ed Sheeran: "I must dare to suck."
> 2. Engineered Rest - Best ideas come in water, motion, or after naps. Executive Mode vs Default Mode.
> 3. Think Inside The Box - "Creativity loves constraints." Dr. Seuss bet.

**Stats:** 144 replies, 560 likes (Jan 4)

**Suggested Reply Option 1:**

> "dare to suck" is basically my entire creative process now.
>
> i brain dump the ugliest half-baked thoughts into a doc. no editing. no judgment. just get the mess out.
>
> 90% is garbage. the 10% that isn't becomes the actual work.

**Suggested Reply Option 2:**

> marines called this "embracing the suck."
>
> you don't wait for perfect conditions. you show up when it's ugly and do the work anyway.
>
> same with creative work. the good stuff comes AFTER you start. never before.

**Suggested Reply Option 3:**

> #2 is slept on.
>
> my best product ideas come in the shower or on walks. never at my desk trying to force it.
>
> ADHD brain needs to wander before it can focus. fighting that is a losing game.

## 4. Lenny Rachitsky - ManusAI for Podcast Prep

**Post Link:** [https://x.com/lennysan](https://x.com/lennysan) (check 1h ago post)

**The Tweet:**

> Been playing with @ManusAI more and it's really really good. It's becoming my go-to for podcast guest prep.

**Stats:** 10 replies, 45 likes (1h ago)

**Suggested Reply Option 1:**

> the real question: how much context are you feeding it?
>
> because manus with your past interview notes + guest's recent work + your show's style = actually useful prep.
>
> manus with just "here's their linkedin" = generic questions anyone could ask.

**Suggested Reply Option 2:**

> this is exactly the pattern.
>
> AI prep tools are only as good as the context you give them. everyone figures this out eventually - the differentiator isn't the AI. it's how much of YOUR context you've captured for it to use.

## 5. Rubio - ChatGPT Memory Collapse

**Post Link:** [https://x.com/rubion1zq](https://x.com/rubion1zq) (check 6h ago post)

**The Tweet:**

> ChatGPT's 'memory collapse' on Feb 5, 2025, erased years of user context, creativity, and trust. It wasn't a glitch, it was a data apocalypse. The year's ultimate betrayal: your 'intelligent' assistant literally forgot who you were.
>
> Maybe 2026 will remember to save.

**Stats:** 5 replies, 10 likes (6h ago)

**Suggested Reply Option 1:**

> this is why relying on chatgpt's memory was always a trap.
>
> your context shouldn't live inside someone else's model. it should live in YOUR system where you control it.
>
> markdown files, docs, project notes - stuff you own. feed it to whatever model you want.

**Suggested Reply Option 2:**

> brutal lesson here: don't outsource your memory to a company that can wipe it.
>
> been obsessively capturing my own context in markdown files for exactly this reason. models come and go. your context is yours.
>
> **shameless plug:** this is literally why i built build-os 😅

## 6. Dan Shipper - Claude Code "Jarvis" Paradigm

**Post Link:** [https://x.com/danshipper](https://x.com/danshipper) (repost from @jonmcbirney, 1h ago)

**The Tweet (Jon McBirney):**

> "Claude code in a trench-coat" I think perfectly describes the most interesting opportunity that I felt in the last six months
>
> CC represents a paradigm shift, a move towards a personal ai assistant like "Jarvis" from iron man, and the packaging of ai/tools etc in this way is a...

**Suggested Reply Option 1:**

> jarvis worked because it had 20 years of context on tony.
>
> knew his projects, his preferences, his past failures, his constraints. that's what made it actually useful vs just smart.
>
> we have the intelligence now. the missing piece is feeding it YOUR context. that's the actual jarvis unlock.

**Suggested Reply Option 2:**

> the jarvis paradigm only works if you've been capturing context.
>
> i've been brain dumping project context into markdown files for months now. brand strategy, SOPs, past decisions, goals - all documented.
>
> claude code with that context = actually useful. claude code without it = just a fancy autocomplete.

## 7. AIOPS - ChatGPT Forgot Context After 3 Messages

**Post Link:** [https://x.com/opsided](https://x.com/opsided) (Jan 5, reply to @inductionheads)

**The Tweet:**

> bruh original ChatGPT was mind blowing at the time but would feel useless now
> constant "as an AI" disclaimers every response
> forgot context after like 3 messages
> refused basic shit for no reason
> we got spoiled by Opus 4.5 and GPT 5
> going back would be painful lmao
> progress moved

**Suggested Reply:**

> "forgot context after like 3 messages"
>
> funny thing is bigger context windows didn't really solve this. 200k tokens sounds like a lot until you realize your project history is 6 months of decisions, docs, and conversations.
>
> the actual solve is capturing context yourself and feeding it in. not hoping the model remembers.

## Reply Guidelines Reminder (DJ Voice)

### The 3 Rules (Every Reply Must Pass)

1. **Can I visualize it?** - Use specific details, not abstract concepts
2. **Can I falsify it?** - Is this your real experience? Could you defend it if challenged?
3. **Can nobody else say this?** - Use your marines background, solo founder journey, ADHD brain

### Voice Principles

- Lowercase casual. perfect grammar not required.
- Short punchy sentences. fragments fine.
- Start with observation or reaction, not "I think..."
- Be direct. cut filler words.
- Longer replies are fine when you have real substance

### DO

- Lead with insight, not agreement
- Reference your specific experience (marines, building, ADHD)
- Get visual and specific - details make it real
- Be self-aware about plugs ("shameless plug incoming", "this is literally why i built...")
- State what smart people are already doing (insider knowledge)
- Use playful language when it fits ("slurping up that yummy context")
- Frame problems as "most people" experiencing what you've solved

### DON'T

- Copy-paste - these are starting points, personalize
- Reply to all at once (looks spammy)
- Just say "great post!" or generic praise
- Open with "love this" or "this resonated"
- Sound like AI wrote it
- Be preachy or lecture-y ("here's what's actually expensive...")
- Use generic thought leader phrases ("obsessed with X over Y")

## Posting Strategy

**Recommended Order:**

1. ✅ DONE - Lenny's "First they came for CX"
2. Next: Shaan's "impress the right people" (1h)
3. Space remaining replies 30+ min apart
4. Save Shaan's "creative brain" post for later (already has 144 replies)

**Timing:** Best engagement window is next 2-3 hours while posts are still fresh.
