## Content Pillars

### Pillar 1: Anti-Complex Tools (35%)

**The angle:** Most productivity tools are the problem, not the solution.

**Hot takes to use:**

- "Your Notion workspace isn't a second brain. It's a second graveyard."
- "Spending 3 hours organizing your tasks isn't productivity. It's procrastination with extra steps."
- "The best productivity system is the one you actually use."
- "If your tool needs a YouTube tutorial, it's already failed."
- "Stop blaming yourself for abandoning Notion. Blame Notion."

**Example posts:**

```
unpopular opinion: most productivity apps are designed to sell courses about productivity apps

actual productivity requires less software, not more
```

```
you don't need:
- 47 Notion templates
- a morning routine from a guy who sleeps 4 hours
- another app

you need:
- one place to dump your thoughts
- AI that actually organizes them
- to stop feeling guilty about being "disorganized"
```

### Pillar 2: Pro-Chaos/ADHD Celebration (30%)

**The angle:** Scattered minds aren't broken. The tools are.

**Hot takes to use:**

- "Your brain isn't disorganized. It's just non-linear."
- "ADHD isn't a productivity problem. Linear thinking is an ADHD problem."
- "The 'just write it down' advice was clearly written by someone who's never lost 47 notebooks."
- "Chaos is a feature, not a bug."

**Example posts:**

```
scattered thoughts? good.
unfinished projects? relatable.
abandoned 6 todo apps? you're in the right place.

welcome to BuildOS. we get it.
```

```
productivity advice for non-ADHD brains:
"just make a list and do the things"

productivity advice for the rest of us:
"dump everything out of your head, let AI figure out what matters, do the one thing that's actually next"
```

### Pillar 3: Product Updates & Building in Public (20%)

**The angle:** Honest updates about what we're building, what works, what doesn't.

**Tone:** Excited but not hype-y. Honest about limitations.

**Example posts:**

```
shipped this week:
- brain dump → AI extracts your actual tasks (not 47 subtasks)
- one-click "what should I do next?"

still working on:
- making it not break when you dump 10,000 words at once
- our own productivity (ironic, we know)
```

```
beta update: 12 new users this week

most common feedback: "wait, that's it?"

yes. that's the point. simple actually works.
```

### Pillar 4: User Wins & Community (15%)

**The angle:** Celebrate users, amplify their wins, build community.

**Tone:** Genuine excitement, specific praise.

**Example posts:**

```
user DM: "I finally finished the project I've been avoiding for 6 months. all I needed was to brain dump it into BuildOS and see the actual steps."

this is why we build. hell yes.
```

```
@username went from "I have no idea what I'm doing with my life" to "oh, I only have 4 things to figure out" in 10 minutes.

that's the whole product tbh.
```

## Engagement Strategy

### Reply Voice

When replying as @build_os:

**DO:**

- React genuinely to their struggle/win
- Offer a perspective (not advice)
- Light product mention only if genuinely relevant
- Be the supportive friend, not the salesperson
- Use humor when it fits

**DON'T:**

- Hard sell the product
- Give unsolicited productivity advice
- Be corporate or formal
- Use "we" in a royal/corporate way (use it casually)
- Lecture anyone

### Reply Templates by Situation

**Someone complaining about Notion/complex tools:**

```
[validate their pain specifically]

[optional hot take about the tool]

[soft product mention only if it fits naturally]
```

Example:

> "the worst part about Notion is how bad you feel for not using it 'right'
>
> it's not you. it's a tool designed for PMs with 8 hours to configure it.
>
> (shameless plug: we built BuildOS specifically for people who've given up on this stuff)"

**Someone sharing ADHD/productivity struggle:**

```
[genuine validation - we get it]

[optional: what actually helps (not preachy)]

[no product mention unless they're asking for recs]
```

Example:

> "this is so real. the whole 'just make a list' advice completely ignores how ADHD brains work.
>
> the problem isn't remembering to do things. it's figuring out wtf to do FIRST when everything feels equally important."

**Someone sharing a win:**

```
[genuine celebration - be specific about what's impressive]

[optional follow-up question]
```

Example:

> "hell yes. the part where you finally saw the 3 actual tasks instead of the 47 imagined ones - that's the breakthrough.
>
> what project are you tackling next?"

**Someone asking for tool recommendations:**

```
[honest answer about what works for their situation]

[mention BuildOS if relevant, with honest caveat]
```

Example:

> "depends on how your brain works honestly.
>
> if you need structure and love organizing → Notion
> if you just want to dump thoughts and have AI figure it out → that's what we built BuildOS for (still in beta, fair warning)"

## Cross-Promotion with @djwayne3

**Occasionally:**

- RT @djwayne3's build-in-public posts with a comment
- Reply to his threads about BuildOS development
- Quote tweet his wins

**Keep it natural.** Don't overdo it. 1-2x per week max.

**Example:**

```
@djwayne3: "shipped the new brain dump flow at 2am. wife found a bug. fixed it by 3am. this is the founder life."

@build_os: "this is what building BuildOS looks like btw. chaos organized by more chaos."
```

---

## What NOT to Do

### Hard No's

- **Never be corporate.** No "We're excited to announce..." language
- **Never lecture.** We're not productivity gurus
- **Never shame.** We celebrate chaos, not fix it
- **Never oversell.** Be honest about being in beta, about limitations
- **Never punch down.** Drag tools and systems, not people
- **Never be defensive.** If someone criticizes, engage genuinely or let it go

### Avoid These Phrases

- "We're excited to..."
- "Announcing our new..."
- "The ultimate solution..."
- "Transform your productivity..."
- "Level up your..."
- "Game-changer"
- "Revolutionary"
- Any LinkedIn-speak

## Competitive Positioning

### Tools We Can Drag (Carefully)

| Tool               | Our Take                                         | How to Mention                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Notion**         | Powerful but overwhelming, makes people feel bad | "Your abandoned Notion workspace isn't a failure. It's a symptom." |
| **Todoist/Things** | Fine if your brain thinks in lists (most don't)  | "Lists work great. If your brain thinks in lists."                 |
| **Asana/Monday**   | Built for teams, not humans                      | "Enterprise tools for your personal life? No thanks."              |
| **Generic AI**     | ChatGPT forgets everything                       | "ChatGPT is smart but it forgets you exist between sessions."      |

### Tools We Respect (Don't Drag)

- **Obsidian** - Different philosophy, power users
- **Linear** - Great product, different use case
- **Things 3** - Beautiful, just different
- **Anti-Planner** (@danidonovan) - Complementary, not competitive

---

## Posting Cadence

- **Daily:** 1-2 original posts (mix of content pillars)
- **Daily:** 3-5 genuine engagements (replies, quote tweets)
- **Weekly:** 1 user win highlight
- **Weekly:** 1 product update (when we have something real)

---

## Quick Voice Check

Before posting, ask:

1. **Would a friend say this?** (Not a company, a friend)
2. **Is it honest?** (Even when uncomfortable)
3. **Does it punch up, not down?** (Drag systems, not people)
4. **Would someone with ADHD feel seen?** (Not fixed, seen)
5. **Is it actually interesting?** (Not filler content)
