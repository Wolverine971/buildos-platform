## Current Strategic Priorities

_Last reviewed: 2026-01-09_

### Priority 1: Own "Context Engineering"

**Status:** Active - Land grab in progress
**Key Account:** @dexhorthy (coined the term)
**Action:** Engage on every post. Credit him. Build relationship.
**Why:** This is THE term that describes BuildOS's value proposition.

### Priority 2: ADHD Audience Development

**Status:** Active
**Key Accounts:** @ADHD_Alien, @HowtoADHD, @StructuredSucc
**Action:** Engage authentically, position BuildOS as "structure for scattered minds"
**Why:** ADHD is the primary user segment - people who need AI to maintain context.

### Priority 3: Competitor Monitoring

**Status:** Active
**Key Accounts:** @dannypostma (PostmaOS), @danidonovan (Anti-Planner)
**Action:** Monitor product updates, feature launches, positioning shifts
**Why:** Stay ahead of competitive landscape.

## Recommendation Log

### 2026-01-09 - Initial Strategy Setup

**Observation:** First structured strategy log created.

**Current State:**

- Context engineering space is nascent but growing
- @dexhorthy evolving concept to "harness engineering" (integration layer)
- Nvidia CES 2026 validated "context management is the new bottleneck"
- Claude Code viral moment created massive awareness of context-first workflows

**Recommendations:**

1. **Double down on @dexhorthy engagement** - He's evolving the concept. Be part of that evolution.
2. **Create content around Nvidia's validation** - Major brand social proof for our thesis.
3. **Watch for Boris Cherny (@bcherny) content** - Claude Code creator, workflow viral moment.
4. **Consider "harness engineering" angle** - The integration layer concept aligns with BuildOS.

**No changes needed to current strategy.** Foundation is solid.

### 2026-01-12 - Context Engineering Goes Mainstream

**Observation:** Major shifts in the context engineering landscape detected.

**Current State:**

- @dexhorthy follower explosion: 3.2K → 10.7K in weeks. Context engineering is now mainstream.
- Dan Shipper (@danshipper) launched "Proof" - an "agent-native" markdown editor (340K+ views on architecture guide)
- New competitor discovered: Acontext.io - building "context data platform" infrastructure
- Mitchell Hashimoto (HashiCorp founder) viral post on AI output quality, amplified by Dex
- ADHD accounts (@HowtoADHD, @StructuredSucc, @danidonovan) largely quiet - opportunity gap

**Implications for BuildOS:**

- The term "context engineering" is gaining legitimacy fast - good validation for thesis
- Dan Shipper's "agent-native architecture" is competing terminology to watch
- Acontext.io is building infrastructure-level context management - potential competitor or partner
- ADHD space is underserved on Twitter right now - could differentiate

**Recommendations:**

1. **Accelerate @dexhorthy engagement** - His rapid growth means his posts get more visibility. Be in every conversation.
2. **Study Dan Shipper's "Proof" deeply** - Understand his "agent-native" angle vs our "context engineering" angle.
3. **Monitor Acontext.io** - They're positioning as infrastructure layer. Could be competitor or integration partner.
4. **Consider creating ADHD content** - Major accounts are quiet. Opportunity to own that intersection.
5. **Add @mitchellh to engagement targets** - HashiCorp founder, quality-focused, aligned with our thesis.

**Strategy Change:** Minor adjustment - increase urgency on context engineering ownership. The window is closing as more players enter.

## Key Metrics to Track

### Engagement Quality

- Are replies getting meaningful responses?
- Are relationships deepening with key accounts?
- Are we becoming recognized in the context engineering conversation?

### Content Resonance

- Which topics get the most engagement?
- Which angles (context eng vs ADHD vs building) resonate most?
- What voice mode (Value vs Cheerleader) works best?

### Competitive Position

- Are competitors shifting positioning?
- Are new players entering the space?
- Is the context engineering narrative growing?
