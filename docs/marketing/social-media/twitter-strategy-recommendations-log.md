## Current Strategic Priorities

_Last reviewed: 2026-01-09_

### Priority 1: Own "Context Engineering"

**Status:** Active - Land grab in progress
**Key Account:** @dexhorthy (coined the term)
**Action:** Engage on every post. Credit him. Build relationship.
**Why:** This is THE term that describes BuildOS's value proposition.

### Priority 2: ADHD Audience Development

**Status:** Active
**Key Accounts:** @ADHD_Alien, @HowtoADHD, @StructuredSucc
**Action:** Engage authentically, position BuildOS as "structure for scattered minds"
**Why:** ADHD is the primary user segment - people who need AI to maintain context.

### Priority 3: Competitor Monitoring

**Status:** Active
**Key Accounts:** @dannypostma (PostmaOS), @danidonovan (Anti-Planner)
**Action:** Monitor product updates, feature launches, positioning shifts
**Why:** Stay ahead of competitive landscape.

## Recommendation Log

### 2026-01-09 - Initial Strategy Setup

**Observation:** First structured strategy log created.

**Current State:**

- Context engineering space is nascent but growing
- @dexhorthy evolving concept to "harness engineering" (integration layer)
- Nvidia CES 2026 validated "context management is the new bottleneck"
- Claude Code viral moment created massive awareness of context-first workflows

**Recommendations:**

1. **Double down on @dexhorthy engagement** - He's evolving the concept. Be part of that evolution.
2. **Create content around Nvidia's validation** - Major brand social proof for our thesis.
3. **Watch for Boris Cherny (@bcherny) content** - Claude Code creator, workflow viral moment.
4. **Consider "harness engineering" angle** - The integration layer concept aligns with BuildOS.

**No changes needed to current strategy.** Foundation is solid.

---

### 2026-01-12 - Context Engineering Goes Mainstream

**Observation:** Major shifts in the context engineering landscape detected.

**Current State:**

- @dexhorthy follower explosion: 3.2K → 10.7K in weeks. Context engineering is now mainstream.
- Dan Shipper (@danshipper) launched "Proof" - an "agent-native" markdown editor (340K+ views on architecture guide)
- New competitor discovered: Acontext.io - building "context data platform" infrastructure
- Mitchell Hashimoto (HashiCorp founder) viral post on AI output quality, amplified by Dex
- ADHD accounts (@HowtoADHD, @StructuredSucc, @danidonovan) largely quiet - opportunity gap

**Implications for BuildOS:**

- The term "context engineering" is gaining legitimacy fast - good validation for thesis
- Dan Shipper's "agent-native architecture" is competing terminology to watch
- Acontext.io is building infrastructure-level context management - potential competitor or partner
- ADHD space is underserved on Twitter right now - could differentiate

**Recommendations:**

1. **Accelerate @dexhorthy engagement** - His rapid growth means his posts get more visibility. Be in every conversation.
2. **Study Dan Shipper's "Proof" deeply** - Understand his "agent-native" angle vs our "context engineering" angle.
3. **Monitor Acontext.io** - They're positioning as infrastructure layer. Could be competitor or integration partner.
4. **Consider creating ADHD content** - Major accounts are quiet. Opportunity to own that intersection.
5. **Add @mitchellh to engagement targets** - HashiCorp founder, quality-focused, aligned with our thesis.

**Strategy Change:** Minor adjustment - increase urgency on context engineering ownership. The window is closing as more players enter.

### 2026-01-24 - Claude Code Ecosystem Exploding

**Observation:** Major follower growth across Claude Code and context engineering accounts. Boris Cherny (Claude Code creator) jumped from 163.7K → 183.9K followers (+20K in 11 days). He's actively asking for Skills feedback. Dex continues growing (10.7K → 11.3K). Dan Shipper's "agent-native" terminology gaining traction via Vibe Code Camp.

**Implications for BuildOS:**

- Claude Code Skills pattern is becoming the standard for AI-assisted development
- Context engineering is validated but faces competing terminology ("agent-native")
- The Claude Code team is accessible and asking for feedback - direct engagement opportunity
- AI code tools are fragmenting massively (Dex listed 12+ tools) - differentiation via context is key

**Recommendations:**

1. **Engage @bcherny on Skills post NOW** - He's directly asking for feedback. Share BuildOS usage patterns.
2. **Maintain @dexhorthy relationship** - Continue heavy engagement, he owns the term.
3. **Watch Dan Shipper's "agent-native" framing** - Competing terminology for same concepts.
4. **Create content about Skills usage** - Real usage stories from BuildOS could resonate.
5. **Note @ShaanVP follower decline** (515K → 457.8K) - Interesting market signal.

**Strategy Change:** Minor adjustment - add Claude Code team (@bcherny, @trq212) to Tier 1 engagement priority.

---

### 2026-01-24 - @build_os Product Account Warmup

**Observation:** First dedicated @build_os warmup scan. Found existing engagements from Jan 22 (replies to @xoxoLove_Liyah and @kulshows about Notion frustration). Engagement quality is minimal - "agreed" reply is too weak. No recent @djwayne3 content for cross-promo.

**@build_os Engagement Quality Issues:**

- Jan 22 reply to @kulshows was just "agreed" - no value added, no personality
- Product accounts need to add value, show voice, or ask questions - not just validate
- 80/20 rule (80% value, 20% product mentions) not being followed

**Implications for BuildOS:**

- Notion frustration posts are common but often from template sellers - need careful filtering
- AI memory complaints (@NoMoreWaitingVA) represent strong positioning opportunity
- ADHD Twitter remains quiet - major accounts inactive
- DaySavvy discovered as new ADHD productivity competitor

**Recommendations:**

1. **Improve @build_os engagement quality** - Add value or personality, not just "agreed"
2. **Follow up on @kulshows thread** - Add a second reply with insight or question
3. **Engage @NoMoreWaitingVA on AI memory** - Perfect context engineering angle
4. **Monitor DaySavvy (@4rham_malik)** - New ADHD productivity competitor
5. **@djwayne3 needs to post** - @build_os has no cross-promo without founder content

**Strategy Change:** Minor - Establish quality standards for @build_os replies. Minimum requirements: add insight, show personality, or ask a question. No more single-word validations.

---

### 2026-02-01 - Boris Cherny Viral Moment + Claude Code Explosion

**Observation:** Boris Cherny (@bcherny) posted a Claude Code tips thread that went massively viral - 4.2M views, 640 replies, 36K likes. He gained +26K followers in 2 days (193.8K → 220.1K). At the end of the thread, he directly asked "What do you want to hear about next?" - a golden opportunity for engagement.

**Additional Findings:**

- @steipete (Peter Steinberger, 215K followers) posted contrarian take: "I don't let Claude Code on my codebase. It's all codex. Would be too buggy with Opus." - Claude vs Codex debate happening
- @levelsio hit 809.6K followers (+15K), revenue in bio: $219K/m total
- Nina Lopatina (works at ContextualAI) followed @djwayne3 - strategic connection
- Dex continues posting about something "coming" with his team

**Implications for BuildOS:**

- Claude Code is THE tool for builders right now - validates our LLM choice
- Boris is accessible and asking for feedback - rare direct engagement opportunity
- Context management is becoming the key differentiator in AI tools discussions
- The Claude vs Codex debate creates natural opportunity to share BuildOS experience

**Recommendations:**

1. **URGENT: Engage Boris's feedback request** - Ask for context management content
2. **Reply to Boris tips thread** - Share real BuildOS/Claude Code experience
3. **Join steipete debate** - Defend Claude Code with specific CLAUDE.md examples
4. **Follow Nina Lopatina back** - She works at ContextualAI, strategic relationship
5. **Continue Dex engagement** - He's still defining context engineering space

**Strategy Change:** Minor priority shift - Claude Code team engagement becomes top priority for next 24-48h while thread is hot. The 4.2M views mean any reply gets massive visibility.

### 2026-02-05 - Cowork Plugins Trigger $285B "SaaS-pocalypse"

**Observation:** Anthropic launched Cowork (Claude Code for non-coding work) and 11 open-source plugins on Jan 30, including a legal plugin that caused a $285B stock selloff across software/SaaS stocks (Feb 3-4). Thomson Reuters dropped 16%, LegalZoom 20%, Wolters Kluwer 13%. Media calling it the "SaaS-pocalypse." Boris Cherny described Cowork as Claude Code expanding beyond coding. He also announced plugins as "the first major feature in Claude Code that I've gotten the opportunity to lead."

**Additional Findings:**

- Boris posted about non-coding usage: vacation research, slide decks, email cleanup, subscription cancellation, wedding photo recovery
- Cowork built in ~1.5 weeks using Claude Code itself. Available for Pro subscribers as research preview (Jan 16)
- Dan Shipper posted 2026 AI predictions podcast with Reid Hoffman - "agents amplifying work process"
- YC Spring 2026 Request for Startups dropped - AI-native companies as the thesis
- Levelsio predicted "2026 = year of AI world models"
- Simon Willison active with OpenClaw/Docker posts (Feb 2)
- New AI ADHD tools gaining traction: Saner.AI, Goblin Tools

**Implications for BuildOS:**

- **MASSIVE VALIDATION**: Context-specific AI beating generic SaaS is exactly BuildOS's thesis. The market is literally pricing this in.
- Cowork plugins = context engineering made distributable. Plugins bundle context, tools, and workflows for specific domains.
- BuildOS is on the RIGHT side of this disruption - AI-native, not traditional SaaS being disrupted
- YC Spring 2026 RFS explicitly calls for AI-native companies - BuildOS has been this since May 2025
- The "SaaS-pocalypse" creates a natural content opportunity to explain context engineering
- Boris's posts continue getting massive visibility - engagement here is highest-leverage activity

**Recommendations:**

1. **URGENT: Engage Boris on Cowork and plugins posts** - The conversation is hot, every hour it cools
2. **Jump into SaaS-pocalypse threads** with context engineering angle - explain WHY this is happening
3. **Engage Dex on the validation** - his "context engineering" thesis just caused a $285B market event
4. **Consider a standalone post/thread** about BuildOS being AI-native and what context engineering means for the future of software
5. **Monitor Danny Postma** - if PostmaOS is SaaS-style, Cowork might threaten his model
6. **Track new AI ADHD tools** (Saner.AI, Goblin Tools) as competitive intelligence for BuildOS's ADHD positioning

**Strategy Change:** Minor priority shift - Cowork/SaaS-pocalypse creates urgent 48-72h engagement window. All engagement should tie back to context engineering narrative. This is the biggest validation event since Dex's original "context engineering" post went viral.

### 2026-02-07 - Fast Mode Launch + Dex Gets Latent Space Podcast

**Observation:** Boris Cherny launched experimental 2.5x faster Opus 4.6 ("fast mode") for Claude Code - directly asking for feedback. Simon Willison wrote about "Software Factory" approach where AI writes AND reviews all code ($1K/engineer/day in tokens). MAJOR: Dex (who coined "context engineering") is being handed the Latent Space podcast by swyx. Dan Shipper gained 4K followers overnight, pushing "Compound Engineering" as competing terminology.

**Additional Findings:**

- Boris: 245.4K followers. Fast mode post at 25K views in ~2h, /rewind feature at 114K views (23h), hackathon repost
- Dex: 11.8K followers. "Excessive tool calling = world's most expensive switch statement" (21h). Getting Latent Space podcast.
- Dan Shipper: 90.7K followers. Mysterious 4K follower surge. "Compound Engineering" framework.
- Danny Postma: 167.7K followers. Still "Laying low." Last post Feb 1.
- Simon Willison: 144.7K followers. "Software Factory" post (5h, 27K views). $1K/day token cost discussion.
- Levelsio: 817.3K followers. Casual content, no engagement opportunity.
- DJ Wayne: 258 followers (down from 261). Last post Dec 12, 2025. Follower decline continues.
- ADHD search: @saen_dev ADHD+AI superpower post (4h, 188 views)

**Implications for BuildOS:**

- Fast mode validates Claude Code as THE builder tool. DJ's daily usage gives him authentic perspective for engagement.
- Dex getting Latent Space podcast = "context engineering" is about to get a MASSIVE platform. This is the best possible validation for BuildOS's positioning.
- Dan Shipper's "Compound Engineering" is competing terminology. Need to monitor whether it gains traction vs "context engineering."
- Simon Willison's "Software Factory" discussion about AI writing all code + token costs directly maps to BuildOS's development approach.
- Claude Code hackathon ($100K in API credits) is a building-in-public content opportunity for DJ.
- DJ's follower decline (261 -> 258) shows cost of inactivity. Need original content.

**Recommendations:**

1. **URGENT: Engage Boris's fast mode post** - He's directly asking for feedback. DJ uses Claude Code daily. Ultra-fresh (~2h), will hit millions of views.
2. **Engage Simon Willison on "Software Factory"** - DJ is literally building this way. Share real experience with AI-first development.
3. **Engage Dex on tool calling post + acknowledge Latent Space move** - Deepen relationship BEFORE his audience explodes. This is the most strategic relationship in DJ's network.
4. **Engage @saen_dev on ADHD+AI** - Build ADHD audience presence with authentic intersection content.
5. **Consider entering Claude Code hackathon** - Building in public opportunity, even if DJ doesn't win.
6. **DJ MUST start posting original content** - Follower decline accelerating. Hackathon entry could be the catalyst.

**Strategy Change:** Minor adjustment - Dex getting Latent Space podcast is a watershed moment for "context engineering." Increase urgency on Dex relationship. Also add @simonw to regular engagement rotation - his AI development discourse aligns perfectly with BuildOS thesis.
