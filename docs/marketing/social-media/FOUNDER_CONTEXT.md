## Voice Characteristics

### Core Voice

- **Learning voice, not authoritative** - "This is what I've tried, this is what I've learned"
- **Direct, no bullshit** - Cut filler words, be specific
- **Action-oriented, grindy** - I tinker, I work, I build, I get it working
- **Comfortable with uncertainty** - AI/context engineering is too new for answers
- **Hates inauthenticity** - Especially LinkedIn thought leader types

### Platform Differences

| Aspect       | Twitter                          | LinkedIn                             |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Tone**     | lowercase casual, fragments fine | Professional but authentic           |
| **Length**   | Short, punchy                    | Longer-form, 1,000-3,000 chars       |
| **Depth**    | Quick takes, hot takes           | More nuanced, storytelling           |
| **Audience** | Indie hackers, builders          | Tech professionals, founders, VCs    |
| **Swearing** | OK in moderation                 | Avoid professionally (occasional OK) |

### How DJ Explains BuildOS

> "BuildOS is an AI-first project organization tool where you brain dump information and it organizes information for you. Anything could be a project, you can talk to it and it organizes for you. You can keep going back to this - any project you're going to keep coming back to, store in BuildOS as opposed to ChatGPT, keep coming back and building on the last conversation or last place where you made progress."

### Words/Phrases He Uses Naturally

- AI-first project organization
- Brain dump information
- Context
- "Keep coming back to the same project"
- "Build on" (previous work/conversations)
- "The agent knows shit too"
- "Thought partner"

## Background & Origin Story

### Military Background (Use Sparingly - "A Nice Little Treat")

- **Marine Corps**: 2012-2017 (5 years)
- **Path**: Infantry (3/11) → Scout Sniper (3/17) → Tried out for MARSOC (didn't get selected) → Got out to become entrepreneur
- **Key Lessons That Apply to Building**:
    - Five-paragraph order planning (reconnaissance requires heavy planning)
    - Long-range precision shooting requires detail, methodical approach
    - Stalking requires patience and concentration
    - Concentration for long periods → translates to programming
- **How to Use**: Mention occasionally as background color, not the main identity. "Nice little treat" not the headline.

### Path to Tech

- Read Tim Ferriss: "If you want to succeed as entrepreneur, you need to be technical or you're at the mercy of whoever is technical"
- **Sabio Coding Bootcamp** (LA) - founder was old Myspace guy
- Fun fact: Failed a programming class in community college before Marines, but bootcamp clicked
- Hired at Sabio after bootcamp, then moved back to East Coast

### Career Timeline

| When             | Where                 | What                                                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2012-2017        | USMC                  | Infantry → Scout Sniper → MARSOC tryout                                 |
| Post-bootcamp    | Sabio                 | Hired on after graduating                                               |
| Next             | Census Bureau         | Making Census data accessible                                           |
| Next             | [Company]             | Platform for Marine Corps lawyers to search cases                       |
| Next             | [Company]             | Intelligence document ingest system for Air Force (before AI did this!) |
| ~2023-March 2025 | **Curri** (YC-backed) | Delivery logistics - see details below                                  |
| May 2025         | **BuildOS**           | Started building                                                        |

### Curri Experience (Highly Relevant)

**What Curri Does**: YC-backed delivery logistics company

**What DJ Built**:

1. **Exception System**: Changed from dispatchers monitoring deliveries to proactively pinging them via queue system when issues arise. "They can chill and then get pinged when they need to do something."

2. **Integrations Guy** (Most Relevant to BuildOS):
    - Hooked up Uber's API for when small packages couldn't find drivers in network
    - Algorithm searched drivers based on: search radius, price, time spent searching
    - If criteria not met → fall back to Uber
    - Then expanded to: Lyft, DoorDash, other delivery providers
    - "API reverse engineering stuff" - hacking integrations together
    - **This directly translates to connecting tools to BuildOS AI agent**
    - Has been solving "how do you connect systems intelligently" before AI made it trendy

3. Map visualization features

**Key Frustration at Curri** (Content Gold):

- Manager wanted Linear kept up to date with progress
- DJ's reaction: "Just look at my pull requests. This is such a hassle."
- Linear was extra task that didn't help him, only helped managers
- **Would rather have a thought partner like BuildOS that updates as you talk to it**
- "I don't think it helped me with my project at all. It was only for managers."

## Core Beliefs & Hot Takes

### On Productivity

> "People are already doing their best. They just need more clarity to be more productive. You're not going to be more productive by budgeting time."

> "It's not about managing your time, it's about clarity. If you get people thinking clearly, they'll be more productive."

> "Most productivity tools and project management apps slow you down because you spend all your time organizing information and not executing."

### On AI

> "AI is already smart as fuck. But being smart is only one piece of the puzzle. You need to give it frameworks."

> "It's like JavaScript - you can code anything with it, but everyone uses React, Vue, Svelte. These frameworks help you get there faster. Same with AI - it knows everything, but you need a framework + context for it to give you actionable information."

> "Context engineering = the information relevant to the task at hand. How do you pull in relevant information strategically? With all data possible, what's relevant to what you're trying to do?"

> "If you want the AI agent to be good, you've got to give it the right context. That's the core insight."

### On Building AI Products

> "People are focused on tools, but should be focused on building context about the user and their goals."

> "MCPs and tool use - you're not just going to throw all the tools at AI and it's going to do a great job. You need to give it the specific tools for the job. Otherwise, the rest is noise."

### On Startups

> "I like the idea of one strong leader driving the boat. Steve Jobs. Brian Chesky's founder mode. As a solo founder, I can get a lot of shit done because I'm steering the boat."

> "You can't just bring in smart people and let them do stuff. You need very specific goals. You need alignment."

### On Data & Measurement

> "Not all that gets measured counts, and not all that counts gets measured. Data can be used to skew the truth rather than reveal it."

## BuildOS Journey

### Origin Frustration

The real "fuck this" moment:

- Having a bunch of chats on random topics
- Never going back to those chats
- ChatGPT knows about him but he doesn't know what it knows
- Wanted transparency: "What does it know about me? Let me fill in the gaps"
- Kept pasting documents into chats: "I want a system that knows where to look"

### Tools Tried Before

| Tool        | Problem                                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Notion      | Too complicated                                                            |
| Obsidian    | Static, high maintenance to organize (still has tons of stale notes there) |
| Apple Notes | Tons of notes, no organization                                             |
| Moleskines  | Physical, no AI                                                            |

Core frustration: "I wanted a thing I could just talk to, and it understands where I'm coming from."

### Product Evolution

**First Version** (May 2025):

- Projects and life goals → simplified to just "projects" (a life goal is a project)
- Project = grouping of information surrounded by an end state (point A → point B)
- Had tasks, calendar events, brain dumping

**Key Pivots**:

1. Brain dumping is great, but **agent should talk back** - "the agent knows shit too"
2. Not just projects/tasks/calendars → projects with **defined goals, documents, milestones, plans**
3. System should help you get to end state: "Here's the end goal, here are milestones, here's the plan, here are tasks. Go step by step."

**What Flopped**: Just simple projects and tasks. Need more dynamic thing.

**Vision**: "Become the Palantir of projects" - develop an ontology so BuildOS can handle any project and gracefully organize data.

### Features Proud Of

1. **Agentic chat** - "just chat with the OS, it understands the tools"
2. **Ontology and graph view** - "we think in terms of goals and tasks"

### Current State (As of Jan 2026)

- ~70 signups, no active users yet
- Few beta users
- **Hardest problem**: Making it as good as ChatGPT + figuring out marketing
- **What keeps him up**: "Is it solving a real problem? It's solving it for me, but explaining to others is hard. Differentiating from ChatGPT/Claude is hard."
- **What he loves**: "It's building context. That part is really powerful."

## Things That Annoy Him

### AI Space

- **MCPs and tool use hype** - throwing all tools at AI doesn't work, need specific tools

### Productivity Culture

- Packed calendars
- Meetings back to back

### LinkedIn

- "Everyone's trying to be a thought leader and just be so inauthentic and not real"

---

## Content Pillars

### Pillar 1: Context Engineering (35%)

**Your Angle:** "Context > agents. AI that remembers beats AI that does."

- AI memory/context problems nobody talks about
- MCPs and tool use contrarian takes
- Context engineering concepts
- Curri integrations → "I was doing tool use before AI made it trendy"

### Pillar 2: Building in Public (30%)

**Your Angle:** "Learning voice, not authoritative. Sharing the grind."

- What you were wrong about
- Real numbers (~70 signups, the struggle)
- Product evolution and pivots
- Failures and lessons learned

### Pillar 3: AI + Productivity Insights (20%)

**Your Angle:** "Clarity > time management. Context > prompts."

- The context problem (pasting docs into ChatGPT)
- Productivity tools slow you down
- Frameworks for AI, not just intelligence

### Pillar 4: Contrarian Takes (15%)

**Your Angle:** "Blue collar software engineering. Tinker, work, build."

- Productivity myths (timeboxing doesn't work)
- AI myths (being smart isn't the thing)
- Your second brain is a graveyard
- PM tools are for managers, not makers

## Unique Positioning

### What Makes DJ Different

1. **Integration experience before AI**: Built Uber/Lyft/DoorDash integrations at Curri - has been solving "connect systems intelligently" for years, now doing it with AI

2. **Military background** (use sparingly): Scout sniper → methodical, detail-oriented, can concentrate for long periods

3. **Built document ingest system for Air Force before AI**: Was solving the "make documents searchable" problem before LLMs

4. **Solo founder shipping fast**: Action-oriented who prototypes and iterates

5. **Contrarian thinker**: Naturally asks "what's the opposite view?" and stress tests ideas

6. **Eating own dogfood**: Actually uses BuildOS for his projects, not just building it

### The Curri → BuildOS Connection

The integration work at Curri (connecting Uber, Lyft, DoorDash APIs based on intelligent criteria) is essentially what he's now doing with AI tools at BuildOS. He's been doing "agentic tool use" before it was called that.

### "Blue Collar Software Engineering"

> "I tinker, I work, I build, I get it working for me. Through trial and error, I find a system that works."

- Not intellectual with AI - just trying to make it useful
- Thought partner, clarify thinking
- "Piecing it together to make it useful" vs "I have the answer"
