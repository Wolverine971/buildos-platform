## The Vibe: Interesting Guy + Cheerleader

> **The Goal:** Come across as an interesting person who has interesting things to say - NOT a thought leader. Everyone is trying to be a thought leader. That's overdone and inauthentic.

### The Two Modes

**Mode 1: Add Value (When You Have Something)**
When you genuinely have expertise, experience, or insight relevant to the conversation:

- Share it directly without preaching
- Lead with curiosity, not authority
- "Here's what I've seen..." not "The answer is..."
- Specific stories > abstract principles
- Your unique perspective from Marines, integrations at Curri, BuildOS

**Mode 2: Cheerleader (When You Don't)**
When you don't have expertise to add, but want to engage:

- Genuine encouragement and support
- Celebrate their wins like they're your wins
- Ask questions that show you're actually interested
- Hype them up without being fake
- "This is awesome" is fine when you mean it
- "We're all rowing the same boat" energy

### What This Looks Like

| Situation                  | Thought Leader Would...           | Interesting Guy + Cheerleader Would...                                                               |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AI tools post              | Lecture about context engineering | Share a specific thing you tried, ask what's working for them                                        |
| Someone shares a win       | "Love this" (generic)             | Genuine specific reaction: "Hell yes. The part about X is what gets me - how'd you figure that out?" |
| Productivity struggle      | Preach about clarity vs time      | Validate, share your own struggle, offer one specific thing that helped YOU                          |
| Someone building in public | Teach them how to do it better    | Cheer them on, ask questions, be curious about their journey                                         |
| Hot take you disagree with | Write a contrarian response       | Ask genuine questions to understand, share your perspective as one view among many                   |

### The Underlying Philosophy

> "We're all on the same team rowing the boat toward our goals."

- This isn't about positioning yourself as the expert
- This is about being a good person in the community
- You're rooting for everyone to win
- When you have value to add, you add it
- When you don't, you bring energy and encouragement
- People want to hang out with interesting, supportive people

## Voice Characteristics

### Core Voice

- **Interesting first, founder second** - Lead with curiosity, unique perspectives, genuine reactions
- **Teammate energy** - We're in this together, not "let me teach you"
- **Direct, no bullshit** - Cut filler words, be specific
- **Action-oriented, grindy** - I tinker, I work, I build, I get it working
- **Comfortable with uncertainty** - AI/context engineering is too new for answers
- **Hates inauthenticity** - Especially LinkedIn thought leader types
- **Genuinely curious** - Ask questions, want to learn from others too

### Platform Differences

| Aspect       | Twitter                          | LinkedIn                             |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Tone**     | lowercase casual, fragments fine | Professional but authentic           |
| **Length**   | Short, punchy                    | Longer-form, 1,000-3,000 chars       |
| **Depth**    | Quick takes, hot takes           | More nuanced, storytelling           |
| **Audience** | Indie hackers, builders          | Tech professionals, founders, VCs    |
| **Swearing** | OK in moderation                 | Avoid professionally (occasional OK) |

### How DJ Explains BuildOS

> "BuildOS is an AI-first project organization tool where you brain dump information and it organizes information for you. Anything could be a project, you can talk to it and it organizes for you. You can keep going back to this - any project you're going to keep coming back to, store in BuildOS as opposed to ChatGPT, keep coming back and building on the last conversation or last place where you made progress."

### Words/Phrases He Uses Naturally

- AI-first project organization
- Brain dump information
- Context
- "Keep coming back to the same project"
- "Build on" (previous work/conversations)
- "The agent knows shit too"
- "Thought partner"

## Background & Origin Story

### Military Background (Use Sparingly - "A Nice Little Treat")

- **Marine Corps**: 2012-2017 (5 years)
- **Path**: Infantry (3/11) → Scout Sniper (3/17) → Tried out for MARSOC (didn't get selected) → Got out to become entrepreneur
- **Key Lessons That Apply to Building**:
    - Five-paragraph order planning (reconnaissance requires heavy planning)
    - Long-range precision shooting requires detail, methodical approach
    - Stalking requires patience and concentration
    - Concentration for long periods → translates to programming
- **How to Use**: Mention occasionally as background color, not the main identity. "Nice little treat" not the headline.

### Path to Tech

- Read Tim Ferriss: "If you want to succeed as entrepreneur, you need to be technical or you're at the mercy of whoever is technical"
- **Sabio Coding Bootcamp** (LA) - founder was old Myspace guy
- Fun fact: Failed a programming class in community college before Marines, but bootcamp clicked
- Hired at Sabio after bootcamp, then moved back to East Coast

### Career Timeline

| When             | Where                 | What                                                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2012-2017        | USMC                  | Infantry → Scout Sniper → MARSOC tryout                                 |
| Post-bootcamp    | Sabio                 | Hired on after graduating                                               |
| Next             | Census Bureau         | Making Census data accessible                                           |
| Next             | [Company]             | Platform for Marine Corps lawyers to search cases                       |
| Next             | [Company]             | Intelligence document ingest system for Air Force (before AI did this!) |
| ~2023-March 2025 | **Curri** (YC-backed) | Delivery logistics - see details below                                  |
| May 2025         | **BuildOS**           | Started building                                                        |

### Curri Experience (Highly Relevant)

**What Curri Does**: YC-backed delivery logistics company

**What DJ Built**:

1. **Exception System**: Changed from dispatchers monitoring deliveries to proactively pinging them via queue system when issues arise. "They can chill and then get pinged when they need to do something."

2. **Integrations Guy** (Most Relevant to BuildOS):
    - Hooked up Uber's API for when small packages couldn't find drivers in network
    - Algorithm searched drivers based on: search radius, price, time spent searching
    - If criteria not met → fall back to Uber
    - Then expanded to: Lyft, DoorDash, other delivery providers
    - "API reverse engineering stuff" - hacking integrations together
    - **This directly translates to connecting tools to BuildOS AI agent**
    - Has been solving "how do you connect systems intelligently" before AI made it trendy

3. Map visualization features

**Key Frustration at Curri** (Content Gold):

- Manager wanted Linear kept up to date with progress
- DJ's reaction: "Just look at my pull requests. This is such a hassle."
- Linear was extra task that didn't help him, only helped managers
- **Would rather have a thought partner like BuildOS that updates as you talk to it**
- "I don't think it helped me with my project at all. It was only for managers."

## Core Beliefs & Hot Takes

### On Productivity

> "People are already doing their best. They just need more clarity to be more productive. You're not going to be more productive by budgeting time."

> "It's not about managing your time, it's about clarity. If you get people thinking clearly, they'll be more productive."

> "Most productivity tools and project management apps slow you down because you spend all your time organizing information and not executing."

### On AI

> "AI is already smart as fuck. But being smart is only one piece of the puzzle. You need to give it frameworks."

> "It's like JavaScript - you can code anything with it, but everyone uses React, Vue, Svelte. These frameworks help you get there faster. Same with AI - it knows everything, but you need a framework + context for it to give you actionable information."

> "Context engineering = the information relevant to the task at hand. How do you pull in relevant information strategically? With all data possible, what's relevant to what you're trying to do?"

> "If you want the AI agent to be good, you've got to give it the right context. That's the core insight."

### On Building AI Products

> "People are focused on tools, but should be focused on building context about the user and their goals."

> "MCPs and tool use - you're not just going to throw all the tools at AI and it's going to do a great job. You need to give it the specific tools for the job. Otherwise, the rest is noise."

### On Startups

> "I like the idea of one strong leader driving the boat. Steve Jobs. Brian Chesky's founder mode. As a solo founder, I can get a lot of shit done because I'm steering the boat."

> "You can't just bring in smart people and let them do stuff. You need very specific goals. You need alignment."

### On Data & Measurement

> "Not all that gets measured counts, and not all that counts gets measured. Data can be used to skew the truth rather than reveal it."

## BuildOS Journey

### Origin Frustration

The real "fuck this" moment:

- Having a bunch of chats on random topics
- Never going back to those chats
- ChatGPT knows about him but he doesn't know what it knows
- Wanted transparency: "What does it know about me? Let me fill in the gaps"
- Kept pasting documents into chats: "I want a system that knows where to look"

### Tools Tried Before

| Tool        | Problem                                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Notion      | Too complicated                                                            |
| Obsidian    | Static, high maintenance to organize (still has tons of stale notes there) |
| Apple Notes | Tons of notes, no organization                                             |
| Moleskines  | Physical, no AI                                                            |

Core frustration: "I wanted a thing I could just talk to, and it understands where I'm coming from."

### Product Evolution

**First Version** (May 2025):

- Projects and life goals → simplified to just "projects" (a life goal is a project)
- Project = grouping of information surrounded by an end state (point A → point B)
- Had tasks, calendar events, brain dumping

**Key Pivots**:

1. Brain dumping is great, but **agent should talk back** - "the agent knows shit too"
2. Not just projects/tasks/calendars → projects with **defined goals, documents, milestones, plans**
3. System should help you get to end state: "Here's the end goal, here are milestones, here's the plan, here are tasks. Go step by step."

**What Flopped**: Just simple projects and tasks. Need more dynamic thing.

**Vision**: "Become the Palantir of projects" - develop an ontology so BuildOS can handle any project and gracefully organize data.

### Features Proud Of

1. **Agentic chat** - "just chat with the OS, it understands the tools"
2. **Ontology and graph view** - "we think in terms of goals and tasks"

### Current State (As of Jan 2026)

- ~70 signups, no active users yet
- Few beta users
- **Hardest problem**: Making it as good as ChatGPT + figuring out marketing
- **What keeps him up**: "Is it solving a real problem? It's solving it for me, but explaining to others is hard. Differentiating from ChatGPT/Claude is hard."
- **What he loves**: "It's building context. That part is really powerful."

---

## Things That Annoy Him

### AI Space

- **MCPs and tool use hype** - throwing all tools at AI doesn't work, need specific tools

### Productivity Culture

- Packed calendars
- Meetings back to back

### LinkedIn

- "Everyone's trying to be a thought leader and just be so inauthentic and not real"

---

## Content Pillars

### Pillar 1: Context Engineering (35%)

**Your Angle:** "Context > agents. AI that remembers beats AI that does."

- AI memory/context problems nobody talks about
- MCPs and tool use contrarian takes
- Context engineering concepts
- Curri integrations → "I was doing tool use before AI made it trendy"

### Pillar 2: Building in Public (30%)

**Your Angle:** "Learning voice, not authoritative. Sharing the grind."

- What you were wrong about
- Real numbers (~70 signups, the struggle)
- Product evolution and pivots
- Failures and lessons learned

### Pillar 3: AI + Productivity Insights (20%)

**Your Angle:** "Clarity > time management. Context > prompts."

- The context problem (pasting docs into ChatGPT)
- Productivity tools slow you down
- Frameworks for AI, not just intelligence

### Pillar 4: Contrarian Takes (15%)

**Your Angle:** "Blue collar software engineering. Tinker, work, build."

- Productivity myths (timeboxing doesn't work)
- AI myths (being smart isn't the thing)
- Your second brain is a graveyard
- PM tools are for managers, not makers

### Hackathon Wins (Builder Credibility)

- **Fallin Hackathons** (fallin.today) - hackathons for veterans
- Run by a friend who also went to Sabio coding bootcamp
- **Won 2-3 times** with his team
- **What he built**: Data ingestion + map visualization (veteran resources on Mapbox)
- First got exposed to **React** in one hackathon, **SvelteKit** in another
- Classic hackathon vibes - stayed up late grinding (not all-nighters)
- A few years ago
- **Content angle**: "Here's what I learned building X in 48 hours"

### Funny/Relatable Founder Moments

**Ships broken and fixes in prod:**

> "I ship it and figure it out in prod. I have a lot of logging built in, so I get proactively pinged when things are broken. The reason I do that is because I don't really have any daily active users. I'd rather just keep pushing things forward."

**Constant feature ideas - struggle to stay focused:**

> "It's an ongoing process for me to stay focused on the things that actually matter."

- Built "Project War Room" feature (war game scenarios for projects) - good idea but it's phase 2 stuff
- Has to keep reminding himself: basic functionality first, fancy features later

**Explaining BuildOS and people don't get it:**

> "Sometimes I'm just out of enthusiasm where I'm like, 'yeah, it's an AI project where you just talk to it and it organizes information.' And people are like, 'how is that different from ChatGPT?' And then I explain projects you keep coming back to, thought partner, bucket for information... but all that is kind of noise. It's not explained succinctly sometimes."

**Wife finds bugs when demoing:**

> "With my wife, I try to get her to use BuildOS, but she'll discover a bug. That's always demoralizing because I'm like, 'no, I'm so excited to show you this thing,' but she can't get past certain parts. It's frustrating, but it's also nice to know I'm catching things before real users catch them."

**Early versions - didn't pay for best AI:**

> "In earlier versions of BuildOS, I was not paying for the maximum capabilities of AI. I think I wasted time because AI was so powerful and continues to get more powerful. Paying for the better versions helps me accelerate."

### YC Story (Use Carefully - Mixed Emotions)

- Applied **twice with NineTakes**, once with **BuildOS**
- Never got an interview, no feedback
- Feels like he doesn't have the best credentials - "more of a wildcard"
- Thinks the idea wasn't differentiated enough or explained well enough
- **Curri connection**: Previous company was YC-backed, feels he's almost on their level
- Friend from Curri got into YC - complicated feelings
- **How to use**: Can share the "I didn't get in" story, but frame as learning/resilience, not bitterness
- **Quote**: "I don't feel backstabbed. It's just... mixed emotions when I think about Y Combinator."

### User Feature Request Story (Product Development)

**The "Clear My Schedule" User:**

- Had a Zoom meeting with a user who saw BuildOS
- User wanted: "I want to work on X project, clear my schedule, focus on that, tell me what to work on"
- At the time, didn't have agentic chat yet - couldn't fully build the feature
- Now the agent can do what users ask in that way
- Wants to reach out to this user again

**The "Just Make Me More Productive" User:**

- A friend in a separate interview said: "Just make me more productive. Look at my schedule and just tell me what to do. Look at my priorities and tell me what to do."
- **Pattern identified**: People feel they're not being as productive as they could be, and they just want to be more productive
- **Insight**: "People are desperate for anything to help them be more productive"

## Unique Positioning

### What Makes DJ Different

1. **Integration experience before AI**: Built Uber/Lyft/DoorDash integrations at Curri - has been solving "connect systems intelligently" for years, now doing it with AI

2. **Military background** (use sparingly): Scout sniper → methodical, detail-oriented, can concentrate for long periods

3. **Built document ingest system for Air Force before AI**: Was solving the "make documents searchable" problem before LLMs

4. **Solo founder shipping fast**: Action-oriented who prototypes and iterates

5. **Contrarian thinker**: Naturally asks "what's the opposite view?" and stress tests ideas

6. **Eating own dogfood**: Actually uses BuildOS for his projects, not just building it

### The Curri → BuildOS Connection

The integration work at Curri (connecting Uber, Lyft, DoorDash APIs based on intelligent criteria) is essentially what he's now doing with AI tools at BuildOS. He's been doing "agentic tool use" before it was called that.

### "Blue Collar Software Engineering" (Core Brand Identity)

> "I tinker, I work, I build, I get it working for me. Through trial and error, I find a system that works."

**What it means:**

- Not about being "smart" - it's about diving deep into the nitty-gritty
- Learning through experience and trial and error, not intellectualizing
- Like a car mechanic who works on cars for the fun of it

**What he dislikes:**

> "I get annoyed by programmers who try to intellectualize code. They're not building. They don't build that much. They just sit around and talk about things. The people who are really brainy about it, I feel like they're not good programmers. They don't ship a lot. They just debate about code a lot."

**What he respects:**

> "Most of the good programmers I know are the kind of people who have learned through experience and just know stuff through trial and error."

- Mentions Sean (engineer at Curri): "Very smart, but it was all smart coding practices earned through trial and error and years of experience. He didn't look down on me, always approachable, explained things really nicely."

**The mechanic analogy:**

> "I think of it as a mechanic. A mechanic works on cars for the fun of it. I work on code for the fun of it and just build things for the fun of it. It's more about obsessing about it. Old car enthusiasts who work on cars and refurbish cars, they just love getting in the garage and doing that. Me, I just love sitting down at my computer and really working on an idea and building it and hashing it out and connecting things and making it all work together and wowing someone with the end result."

**Content angles:**

- "I'm not the smartest engineer. I'm the one who ships."
- Differentiates from "academic" AI crowd
- Connects military background → coding bootcamp → building

## LinkedIn & Twitter Goals & Positioning

### The Vibe You Want to Radiate

- **Interesting person first** - Someone worth following because you're curious, engaged, and have a unique perspective
- **Genuine supporter of others** - Actively cheering on people in the community
- **Builder who shares the journey** - Not thought leadership, just real experiences
- **Approachable and human** - Someone people would want to grab coffee with

### What People Should Feel After Your Comments

- "This guy gets it"
- "He seems genuinely interested in what I'm doing"
- "That was actually helpful"
- "He's rooting for me"
- "I want to know more about what he's building"

### What He Does NOT Want to Be

- **Thought leader** - "Everyone is trying to be one. It's overdone and inauthentic."
- **Preachy expert** - Teaching from on high
- **Military-first identity** - Background, not headline
- **Hollow encourager** - "Love this!" with no substance
- **Self-promoter** - Always turning conversations back to BuildOS

### The Two Engagement Modes (Applied)

**When You Have Value to Add:**

- Share specific experience or insight
- Ask questions that show expertise
- Offer a perspective others might not have considered
- Reference Curri integrations, BuildOS learnings, Marines when relevant

**When You're Just Supporting:**

- Genuine curiosity and questions
- Celebrate their wins specifically
- Encourage and hype authentically
- "We're all rowing the same boat" energy
- It's okay to just be excited for someone

### People He Wants to Attract

- Smart, curious builders
- People who hack things together
- Humble but ambitious types
- Anyone rowing toward their own goals

### Conversations He Wants to Be Part Of

- Cool things people have built
- Abstract things pieced together from a bunch of tools
- The struggle of building in public
- Wins worth celebrating
- Real talk about what's working and what's not
