# Founder Deep-Dive Interview - Round 2

> **Purpose:** Go beyond the surface. Capture the life story, formative moments, and human details that make DJ interesting - not as a founder, but as a person. This is the "Tim Ferriss" interview.
>
> **Why This Matters:** The goal is to come across as an **interesting guy who has interesting things to say**, not a "thought leader." That requires depth. People follow interesting people - and interesting comes from lived experience, unique perspectives, and genuine humanity.
>
> **Instructions:** Take your time with these. Some will be uncomfortable. Some will feel irrelevant. Answer what resonates. Skip what doesn't. But the more you share, the more material we have for authentic engagement.

## After You Complete This

Your answers will be used to:

1. **Humanize the FOUNDER_CONTEXT.md** - Add depth and stories
2. **Inform the "interesting guy" voice** - What makes you unique and worth following
3. **Fuel the "cheerleader" energy** - How you naturally show up for others
4. **Create material for authentic engagement** - Real stories, real perspectives

The goal: When you reply to someone on LinkedIn or Twitter, it should feel like talking to DJ - not "BuildOS Founder DJ." An interesting person who also happens to be building something.
