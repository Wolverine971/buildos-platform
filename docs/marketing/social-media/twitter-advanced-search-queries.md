## 💡 Engagement Tips for Search Results

### DO:
- Reply with empathy first ("I feel this")
- Share a quick tip without selling
- Ask a follow-up question
- Share your own struggle with the problem
- Mention BuildOS ONLY if directly relevant and helpful

### DON'T:
- Copy-paste the same reply
- Immediately pitch BuildOS
- Be the first to reply with a product link
- Engage with tweets that have 0 engagement (bots)
- Reply to verified brand accounts

### Sample Reply Templates:

**For Notion frustration:**
> "I abandoned Notion 6 times. The problem isn't you - complex tools make scattered minds more scattered. What specifically made you give up?"

**For AI context problems:**
> "This is the #1 problem nobody talks about. AI is smart but has amnesia. Context > intelligence."

**For ADHD overwhelm:**
> "Your brain isn't broken, the tool is wrong. ADHD minds need simplicity, not more features. What's worked for you?"
