## 1. TechWriteable (@techwriteable) - ChatGPT Forgets Context

**Post Link:** https://x.com/techwriteable (7h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> We've all gotten to that point on ChatGPT where the chat gets too long and chat gpt forgets what you said 10 prompts ago 😬
>
> So you open a new chat, type "continue where we left off" and get a completely different output❌
>
> Here's how to never start from scratch again>>🧵

**Stats:** 1 reply, 0 RTs, 1 like, 17 views (7h ago)

**Why This Tweet:**
PERFECT fit. This is EXACTLY the problem BuildOS solves - AI context that persists. Low engagement means DJ's reply will stand out. This person is actively looking for solutions to the context problem.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Value Mode - Context Engineering):**

> this is the #1 problem nobody talks about. AI is smart but has amnesia.
>
> been obsessing over this for buildos - the insight is context that compounds beats intelligence that resets. not just "starting over" with better prompts, but building on everything you've already discussed.
>
> curious what solutions you found?

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Value Mode - Specific Experience):**

> felt this hard. at curri i was building integrations across uber/lyft/doordash and keeping context across all those systems was the real challenge.
>
> now building buildos specifically because of this - ai needs to remember your projects, not just your last 10 messages. what did you find works?

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Cheerleader Mode + Question):**

> this is so relatable. the "continue where we left off" gamble is the worst.
>
> what's in the thread? genuinely curious because this is the exact problem i'm trying to solve with buildos.

## 2. alignedbuilder (@alignedbuilder) - Notion Abandoned Story

**Post Link:** https://x.com/alignedbuilder (10h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> The breaking point: half my todos lived in Notion (abandoned), the other half in my head. I had a real customer prospect waiting on follow-up and genuinely couldn't remember if the ball was in my court or his

**Stats:** 1 reply, 0 RTs, 0 likes, 3 views (10h ago)

**Why This Tweet:**
Perfect Notion frustration story with a real consequence (missed customer follow-up). This is the scattered mind problem BuildOS solves. Low engagement = reply will be visible.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Value Mode - Shared Experience):**

> abandoned notion 6 times. the problem isn't you - it's that complex tools make scattered minds more scattered.
>
> i needed something where i could just brain dump everything and it would organize for me. not another system to maintain.
>
> did you find something that works?

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Value Mode - Specific):**

> that feeling of "wait, was the ball in my court?" is the worst.
>
> this is why i started buildos - wanted an ai that actually remembers my projects and context. not another todo list i'll abandon in 3 weeks.
>
> what are you using now?

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Cheerleader Mode):**

> oof. felt this in my soul. the notion → apple notes → back of envelope → forget entirely pipeline is too real.
>
> hope you got back to that prospect!

## 3. Q.E.D (@QEDreal) - ADHD Dopamine Hostage

**Post Link:** https://x.com/QEDreal (5h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> Nothing says ADHD like your brain holding your own dopamine hostage 💀
>
> "You want fun? Best I can do is staring at the launcher for 3 hours"
>
> Executive dysfunction said: no productivity AND no pleasure. Only vibes.
> ✨✨

**Stats:** 0 replies, 0 RTs, 0 likes, 26 views (5h ago)

**Why This Tweet:**
Relatable ADHD content. This is the core audience for BuildOS - people whose brains don't cooperate with traditional productivity systems. Low engagement = good visibility for reply.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Cheerleader Mode - Validate):**

> "no productivity AND no pleasure. only vibes."
>
> this is painfully accurate. the executive dysfunction double-bind where you can't do the thing you need to do OR the thing you want to do.
>
> solidarity.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Value Mode - Light):**

> the launcher staring is too real. my brain does the same thing with code - "you could ship this feature... or we could just look at the terminal for 2 hours"
>
> building buildos partly because i need ai to remember what i was trying to do when my brain forgets

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Cheerleader Mode + Question):**

> executive dysfunction said no productivity AND no pleasure 💀
>
> this is art. what finally gets you unstuck when this happens?

## 4. Boris Cherny (@bcherny) - Claude Code Thread (Still Hot!)

**Post Link:** https://x.com/bcherny/status/[jan31thread]

**The Tweet:**

> I'm Boris and I created Claude Code. I wanted to quickly share a few tips for using Claude Code, sourced directly from the Claude Code team. The way the team uses Claude is different than how I use it. Remember: there is no one right way to use Claude Code -- everyone's setup is [different]...

**Stats:** 838 replies, 6.1K RTs, 48K likes, **7.8M views** (up from 4.2M on Feb 1!)

**Why This Tweet:**
This thread is still viral and growing. Boris gained +14.7K followers since Feb 1 (now 234.8K). Even though it's from Jan 31, engagement is still happening. A thoughtful reply here gets massive visibility.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Value Mode - Real Experience):**

> been building buildos entirely in claude code for 8+ months. the game changer is context management - CLAUDE.md files that tell it the codebase patterns, project context that persists across sessions.
>
> the model is smart. giving it the right context makes it precise.
>
> thanks for building this.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Value Mode - Specific Insight):**

> tip from the trenches: the skills system is brilliant because it's about giving ai specific tools for specific jobs instead of everything at once.
>
> same principle for context - don't dump everything in, curate what's relevant to the task.
>
> context > intelligence every time.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Cheerleader Mode + Question):**

> this thread is gold. using claude code daily and didn't know about half of these tips.
>
> curious - what's the most common mistake you see power users making?

## 5. Mario Fox (@foxmari0) - Timer Tip for ADHD

**Post Link:** https://x.com/foxmari0 (17m ago)

**The Tweet:**

> You need to use a timer.
>
> Set an alarm for anything you want to get done, especially if you suffer from distraction, ADHD, procrastination, etc.
>
> Timers create a concrete deadline.
>
> Bringing an awareness of time that is often lost by the easily distracted.
>
> Best productivity hack

**Stats:** 0 replies, 0 RTs, 0 likes, 5 views (17m ago)

**Why This Tweet:**
Very fresh (17m). ADHD productivity content. Low engagement = first reply opportunity. This is a standard "timeboxing" take - could add nuance from DJ's perspective.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Value Mode - Nuance):**

> timers help with time blindness for sure.
>
> but i've found the bigger problem isn't time management - it's clarity. knowing what to actually work on when you sit down.
>
> timers work when you know what to do. the hard part is figuring that out when your brain has 47 open loops.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Cheerleader Mode + Addition):**

> timers are clutch for time blindness. the pomodoro technique saved me in some coding sessions.
>
> i'd add: writing down what you're working on before starting the timer. otherwise i start the timer and then think "wait... what was i doing?"

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Cheerleader Mode):**

> timers + time blindness is a real combo.
>
> do you use any specific timer app or just phone?

## 6. Dex (@dexhorthy) - Austin + AI Humor

**Post Link:** https://x.com/dexhorthy (Feb 2)

**The Tweet:**

> austin i am at u

(Photo of Austin, TX skyline at night)

**Stats:** Low engagement (personal post)

**Also reposted @SIGKITTEN (12h ago):**

> paperclip me, clanky

(Terminal screenshot - AI humor reference)

**Why This Tweet:**
Dex coined "context engineering" - must maintain relationship. The personal post is low-key but the repost shows he's still engaged in AI discourse. Good opportunity for casual engagement.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Cheerleader Mode - Austin):**

> austin is fire. hitting up any ai/tech events while you're there?

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Reply to SIGKITTEN repost - Value Mode):**

> lol the paperclip maximizer jokes never get old.
>
> though honestly "paperclip me but with context" is closer to what everyone actually wants from ai agents.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Cheerleader Mode):**

> nice shot. hope hlyr.dev is cooking something good out there 👀

## Posting Strategy

**Recommended Order:**

1. **@techwriteable** - Freshest and most aligned with BuildOS thesis (7h, low competition)
2. **@alignedbuilder** - Notion frustration story (10h, very low engagement)
3. **@QEDreal** - ADHD content (5h, build ADHD audience presence)
4. **@foxmari0** - Very fresh (17m), but lower strategic value
5. **@bcherny** - Still getting visibility despite age
6. **@dexhorthy** - Maintain relationship

**Timing:** Start now - morning EST is good for engagement
**Spacing:** 30+ min between replies to avoid spam appearance

## Voice Reminder

### The Philosophy

**Interesting guy + cheerleader. NOT a thought leader.**

### Two Modes

1. **Value Mode:** When you have experience to share - lead with insight, be specific, ask smart questions
2. **Cheerleader Mode:** When you don't - genuine hype, curious questions, celebrate their wins

### The 3 Rules (for Value Mode)

1. Can I visualize it? (specific details)
2. Can I falsify it? (real experience)
3. Can nobody else say this? (unique perspective)

### Quick Do's

- Genuine excitement when cheering someone on
- "hell yes" and specific praise for wins
- Curious questions about their journey
- Teammate energy - we're all rowing together

### Quick Don'ts

- "love this" or "great post" (hollow)
- Preachy setups ("Most people don't realize...")
- Generic observations anyone could make
- Teaching when you're just supporting
- Thought leader energy

## Strategy Recommendations

### Today's Observations

1. **Context/memory complaints are everywhere** - The "ChatGPT forgets" and "Notion abandoned" searches are goldmines for BuildOS positioning
2. **Boris's momentum continues** - His thread went from 4.2M to 7.8M views in 2 days, +14.7K followers
3. **ADHD accounts remain active** - Unlike the major accounts (@HowtoADHD, etc.), smaller creators are posting relatable ADHD content
4. **Claude vs Codex narrative** - Sam Altman posting about Codex while Boris's Claude Code thread goes viral

### Recommendations

1. **Prioritize "ChatGPT forgets" searches** - These people are actively experiencing the problem BuildOS solves
2. **Engage @techwriteable immediately** - They're creating content about the exact problem
3. **Continue Boris engagement** - His thread is still growing, any reply gets visibility
4. **Build ADHD presence through smaller creators** - Major accounts quiet, opportunity with @QEDreal types
5. **Consider a thread about context engineering** - Market is clearly receptive to this framing

### Strategy Update Needed?

[ ] No changes - current strategy is working
[X] Minor tweak - Add "ChatGPT forgets" to regular search rotation, prioritize context memory content
[ ] Significant shift
