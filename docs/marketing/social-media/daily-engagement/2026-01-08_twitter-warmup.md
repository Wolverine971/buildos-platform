## 1. Ethan Mollick - Bookmarks/Context Preservation (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Post Link:** https://x.com/emollick/status/[find-link]

**The Tweet:**

> One X feature that would be extremely useful in the age of AI (and would actually make the X articles feature make more sense) is to let me download my bookmarked posts
>
> The fact that there is no way to do so officially is a huge gap, especially as older bookmarks can't be viewed

**Stats:** 14 replies, 5 RTs, 145 likes, 8.4K views (3h ago)

**Why This Tweet:**
This is EXACTLY the BuildOS thesis. Ethan is talking about the pain of losing context/history - bookmarks disappearing, no way to preserve knowledge. LOW reply count means you can stand out. This is the #1 priority.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Experience - Recommended):**

> been feeling this. my Claude chats are full of breakthroughs I can't find again.
>
> started dumping everything into markdown files just to have a searchable history. not elegant but it works.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Shorter + Question):**

> yes. losing context is the actual problem.
>
> do you have a workaround right now or just accept the loss?

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Direct):**

> the AI memory problem in a nutshell. we keep making smarter tools that forget everything.

## 2. Lenny Rachitsky - AI Survey: Quality Improved

**Post Link:** https://x.com/lennysan/status/[find-link]

**The Tweet:**

> [Survey results showing 70% of PMs and founders report AI improved QUALITY of their work, not just productivity]

**Stats:** ~70 replies (1h ago)

**Why This Tweet:**
Fresh take on AI improving quality, not just speed. Perfect for the "context engineering" angle - quality comes from AI having the right context.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Experience - Recommended):**

> seeing this with claude code daily.
>
> first prompt: generic output. same prompt + my project files: actually knows what I'm building.
>
> the AI didn't get smarter. I just gave it what it needed.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Shorter):**

> makes sense. quality scales with context.
>
> the people seeing gains probably figured out how to actually feed the AI useful information.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Curious):**

> interesting that quality beats speed. that's not the narrative.
>
> curious what they meant by "quality" - better decisions? better writing? catching mistakes?

## 3. Sam Parr - Cross-Country Coach

**Post Link:** https://x.com/thesamparr/status/[find-link]

**The Tweet:**

> [About cross-country coach saying "I'm here to teach you how to be a better man" - unexpected wisdom]

**Stats:** ~11 replies (VERY FRESH ~30m ago)

**Why This Tweet:**
Classic Sam life wisdom post. Can tie to solo founder journey, discipline, the unexpected teachers in life.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Marines - use sparingly):**

> same in the marines. the best leaders never talked about leadership - they'd just make you do something hard and ask "what did you just learn?"
>
> the lesson was never the activity.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Cheerleader + Question - Recommended):**

> love this. the lessons that stick are never the ones being explicitly taught.
>
> what was the moment you realized what he was actually doing?

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Shorter):**

> the lessons absorbed > lessons taught. always.

## 4. Dan Shipper - AI Content Edge, Authentic Voice

**Post Link:** https://x.com/danshipper/status/[find-link]

**The Tweet:**

> [Repost of Every article: "AI makes content trivially easy to generate. Writing-first practitioners like @FredWilson and @joulee have an edge that only sharpens."]

**Stats:** (1h ago)

**Why This Tweet:**
Dan's core thesis - authentic voice + AI is the edge. Perfect for context engineering angle: AI needs YOUR context to produce YOUR voice.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Builder angle - Recommended):**

> the edge isn't just having a voice - it's having a body of work the AI can learn from.
>
> fred and julie have years of writing. that's context. starting from scratch = generic output forever.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Curious):**

> curious how this plays out for builders who don't have a writing practice yet.
>
> feels like the answer is: start documenting now. build the context library before you need it.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Shorter):**

> years of writing = years of context for AI to learn from. that's the moat.

## 5. Levelsio - Shotgun to Sniper Strategy

**Post Link:** https://x.com/levelsio/status/[find-link]

**The Tweet:**

> We actually do shotgun to sniper in life all the time
>
> In dating you go on dates with different people to find a match, then when you find them you double down
>
> In getting a job you apply to lots of companies, then when you get the job you focus on that
>
> Digital nomading...

**Stats:** (1h ago)

**Why This Tweet:**
Classic indie hacker philosophy from levelsio. Can tie to solo founder journey, the importance of exploration before focus.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Experience - Recommended):**

> seeing this in building too. you can't plan your way to product-market fit.
>
> talk to enough people, build enough versions, throw enough at the wall. then when something hits, go all in.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Agree + Add):**

> the hard part is knowing when to switch. most people stay in shotgun mode too long. or sniper too early.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Shorter):**

> shotgun phase isn't wasted effort. it's reconnaissance. can't aim precisely at something you haven't found yet.

## Bonus: Older But High-Value Opportunities

### @emollick - Claude Code for Non-Coders (19h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> I wrote about Claude Code and why non-coders should be paying attention (and playing with the system) - it shows what today's LLMs can do
>
> Along the way I had Claude launch a business for me & build a game that simulates the rise and fall of civilizations.

**Why Consider:**
Directly about Claude Code, which DJ uses daily. Could add value about the context engineering aspect of making Claude Code actually work well.

**Quick Reply Option:**

> been building with claude code daily. the unlock is context - same tool + my project files = actually understands what I'm trying to build.
>
> without that it's just smart autocomplete.

## Posting Strategy

**Recommended Order:**

1. **@emollick bookmarks post** - POST FIRST (3h, only 14 replies - own this thread!)
2. **@thesamparr coach post** - VERY FRESH, within 30 min of first post
3. **@lennysan AI quality** - within 30 min (high relevance)
4. **@danshipper AI content edge** - space 30+ min apart
5. **@levelsio shotgun/sniper** - can do later

**Timing Notes:**

- Space replies 30+ min apart
- Fresh posts (<2h) = lower competition, higher visibility
- 5-7 quality engagements per day max
- Don't reply to all targets at once (looks spammy)

## Voice Reminder

### Two Modes

**Mode 1: Add Value** - When you have something specific to contribute

- Share specific experience or insight
- Lead with curiosity, not authority
- Teammate energy, not teaching

**Mode 2: Cheerleader** - When you don't have a unique angle

- Genuine hype and encouragement
- Curious questions about their journey
- "hell yes" energy is valid

### The 3 Rules (for Value Mode)

1. **Can I visualize it?** - Specific details, not abstractions
2. **Can I falsify it?** - Real experience you could defend
3. **Can nobody else say this?** - Marines (sparingly), solo founder, Claude Code daily user

### Quick Don'ts

- No "love this" or "great post" (hollow)
- No "this resonated" (generic)
- No preachy teaching when you're just supporting
- Don't make it about you when cheering someone on
