### 1. Philip Pinol - "From tools to governed org brain" (Score: 92)
**Link:** Search "Philip Pinol" on LinkedIn
**Post:** Every agent has its own memory, every tool has its own logs. No shared state → no shared intelligence.

**Option A (Value Mode):**
> This is exactly the problem I'm wrestling with building BuildOS. Every AI conversation starts from scratch—no compound learning, no shared context between tools. We've spent years building "second brains" in Notion and Obsidian that go stale the moment we stop manually maintaining them. The real unlock isn't smarter agents, it's agents that share persistent, governed context. What's your take on who should own that context layer—the tools themselves or an independent orchestration layer?

**Option B (Value - shorter):**
> "No shared state → no shared intelligence" — this is the entire problem in one line. I've been building in this space and the pattern I keep seeing is teams stitching together brilliant individual tools that collectively have amnesia. Context engineering is going to matter more than agent engineering. Curious how you're thinking about the governance piece—who decides what context persists?

**Option C (Cheerleader + Value):**
> Hell yes to framing this as a governance problem, not just a tooling problem. This connects to something I've been wrestling with—we don't need more AI that does, we need AI that remembers across doing. The "org brain" framing is spot on.

### 2. Mike Steadman - "I love Mondays" (Score: 87)
**Link:** linkedin.com/in/steadmanmike
**Post:** Positive Monday energy, gratitude, building momentum

**Option A (Cheerleader Mode):**
> There's something about building your own thing that transforms Mondays. When I was in the Marines and later at Curri, Mondays felt like returning to someone else's agenda. Now it's the start of another week where the problems are mine to solve. The energy shift is real. Hope you have a great week crushing it.

**Option B (Cheerleader - shorter):**
> The Monday energy hits different when you're building something that's yours. We're all rowing the same boat—hope this week is a great one.

**Option C (Value + Cheerleader):**
> Fellow vet founder here and I feel this. The transition from structured military schedules to founder chaos somehow made Mondays better, not worse. When every day is a chance to ship, they all become opportunities instead of obligations. Let's get it this week.

### 3. Khalid Anwar - ADHD relationships/reminders (Score: 80)
**Link:** Search "Khalid Anwar ADHD" on LinkedIn
**Post:** ADHD forgetting isn't "not caring"—it's forgetting in a way that looks like not caring. Build reminders as love language.

**Option A (Value Mode):**
> This reframe hit hard. I've struggled with the guilt of forgetting things that matter to people I care about. What I'm finding is that the solution isn't trying harder to remember—it's building systems that remember for me. External brains, not better internal ones. The people in my life have learned that my calendar invite for our catch-up isn't impersonal, it's how I show I care enough to not let it slip.

**Option B (Cheerleader + Value):**
> "Reminders as a love language" is such a generous reframe. For scattered minds, the intention is always there—it's the working memory that fails. Building external systems to hold what our brains drop isn't weakness, it's self-awareness in action. Really appreciate you putting words to this.

**Option C (Shorter - Cheerleader):**
> This is such an important reframe. The intention is there, the working memory isn't—and building systems to bridge that gap is an act of love, not a crutch. Thank you for articulating this.

### 4. Elisha Odemakinde - Building in public (Score: 79)
**Link:** Search "#BuildingInPublic" recent posts
**Post:** Building in public journey/progress

**Option A (Cheerleader Mode):**
> Love seeing the building in public journey. There's something about putting your work out there that creates accountability and attracts the right people. What's been the most surprising feedback you've gotten so far?

**Option B (Value + Cheerleader):**
> Building in public is underrated as a forcing function. It's not just marketing—it's committing to a version of yourself that ships. Rooting for you on this journey. What's been the hardest part about sharing the process publicly?

### 5. Christy Thomas - Building Ela Online (Score: 77)
**Link:** Search "Christy Thomas Ela Online" on LinkedIn
**Post:** Building Ela Online publicly

**Option A (Cheerleader Mode):**
> Rooting for you on this build! There's something about putting the work in public that changes how you approach it. What made you decide to build Ela in the open?

**Option B (Cheerleader + Curiosity):**
> Building in public is one of those things that feels scary and then becomes addictive. The feedback loops are so much faster than building in stealth. What's Ela Online solving—would love to know more about what you're building!

### 6. Lenny Rachitsky - "Why AI products fail" (Score: 74)
**Link:** linkedin.com/in/lennyrachitsky
**Post:** Lessons from 50+ AI deployments on why they fail

**Option A (Value Mode):**
> What I'm finding building in the AI space is that the gap between demo and daily use is enormous. The posts that go viral show the magic—but the products that stick solve the unglamorous context problem. AI that forgets everything between sessions will always feel like a party trick instead of a tool. Curious if the 50+ deployments showed any patterns around context/memory being a failure point.

**Option B (Value - Shorter):**
> The pattern I keep seeing is that AI products fail when they're built around intelligence that resets. Every session starts from scratch = every session is a demo, not a workflow. Context that compounds is what separates tools from toys. Did memory/context come up as a failure pattern in your research?

**Option C (Cheerleader + Value):**
> This is such needed research. My hypothesis building in this space is that "fails to retain context" should be near the top of the list—but it rarely gets talked about because it's less exciting than capabilities. What surprised you most from the 50+ deployments?
