## Tweet Opportunities

### 1. Boris Cherny (@bcherny) - Fast Mode for Opus 4.6 Launch

**Post Link:** https://x.com/bcherny (~2h ago at time of scan)

**The Tweet (thread):**

Post 1:

> We just launched an experimental new fast mode for Opus 4.6.
>
> The team has been building with it for the last few weeks. It's been a huge unlock for me personally, especially when going back and forth with Claude on a tricky problem.

(Quote tweeting @claudeai: "Our teams have been building with a 2.5x-faster version of Claude Opus 4.6. We're now making it available as an early experiment via Claude Code and our API.")

Post 2:

> Use /fast to enable. It uses a lot more compute than Opus 4.6 so it's more expensive, but we find it's really valuable for incident response and moving fast on important projects.

Post 3:

> Excited to hear what you think! Pro & Max users have $50 in free credit to try it out, and it's 50% off until Feb 16.

**Stats:**

- Post 1: 51 replies, 26 RTs, 450 likes, 25K views (~2h old)
- Post 2: 7 replies, 3 RTs, 158 likes, 12K views
- Post 3: 27 replies, 1 RT, 187 likes, 11K views

**Opportunity Type:** AI reality check / Community
**Why This Tweet:**
ULTRA FRESH. Boris is launching a new feature and DIRECTLY asking for feedback ("Excited to hear what you think!"). DJ uses Claude Code daily to build BuildOS with Opus 4.6 - this is a perfect engagement opportunity. The fast mode for "going back and forth on tricky problems" maps directly to BuildOS's development workflow. At only ~2h old with 25K views already, this will likely hit millions. Early, thoughtful replies get the most visibility.

**Engagement Mode:** Value - Real experience with Opus 4.6 in Claude Code

**Replies:** _Pending Stage 2_

---

### 2. Boris Cherny (@bcherny) - /rewind Feature (Thariq Quote)

**Post Link:** https://x.com/bcherny (23h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> A small quality of life improvement. Hope you find it useful!

(Quoting @trq212 from Feb 6: "Now in Claude Code: when you rewind a conversation using /rewind or hitting ESC twice, Claude can summarize the part of the conversation that was rewound. Use this to explore different paths and take the learnings 'back in time'.")

**Stats:** 77 replies, 53 RTs, 1.5K likes, 114K views

**Opportunity Type:** AI reality check / Community
**Why This Tweet:**
The /rewind feature is about CONTEXT MANAGEMENT - exploring different paths without losing what you learned. This is a perfect metaphor for what BuildOS does at the project level. The "without losing context" tagline in the video is exactly BuildOS's thesis. 114K views = good visibility. Still fresh enough at 23h.

**Engagement Mode:** Value - Context that persists

**Replies:** _Pending Stage 2_

---

### 3. Simon Willison (@simonw) - "Software Factory" AI Development

**Post Link:** https://x.com/simonw (5h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> I wrote about the most ambitious form of AI-assisted software development I've seen yet - Strong DM's "Software Factory" approach, where two of the guiding principles are "Code must not be written by humans" and "Code must not be reviewed by humans"

(Link to simonwillison.net blog post)

Follow-up (2h ago):

> Updated my post to add a section with commentary on the glaring detail I glossed over in my first published version: $1,000/engineer/day in token spends, really?

**Stats:** 37 replies, 55 RTs, 310 likes, 27K views (5h old)

**Opportunity Type:** AI reality check / Contrarian
**Why This Tweet:**
Simon is writing about FULLY AI-driven software development - no human code writing OR reviewing. DJ is literally building BuildOS this way with Claude Code. The $1K/day token cost angle ties directly into Boris's fast mode pricing discussion. This is a "Software Factory" approach and DJ has real experience to share. 27K views, 310 likes = strong engagement. DJ follows Simon.

**Engagement Mode:** Value - Real experience building with AI

**Replies:** _Pending Stage 2_

---

### 4. Dex (@dexhorthy) - "Excessive Tool Calling = Expensive Switch Statement"

**Post Link:** https://x.com/dexhorthy (21h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> Excessive tool calling in LLMs is the world's most expensive switch statement

(Linking to podcast/content about AI tool calling efficiency)

**Stats:** ~26 likes, 1.6K views (21h old)

**Additional context:** Dex also posted that swyx is handing him the Latent Space podcast ("Let the man cook" - 22h ago). This is a MAJOR development - Dex (who coined "context engineering") is now getting a major AI podcast platform.

**Opportunity Type:** Context Engineering / Community
**Why This Tweet:**
Dex coined "context engineering." Must maintain relationship. The tool calling observation is insightful and maps to BuildOS's approach - context engineering is about giving AI the right context so it doesn't need to make 50 tool calls. Dex getting Latent Space podcast is huge - he'll have even more influence over AI development discourse.

**Engagement Mode:** Value - Tool calling vs context engineering angle

**Replies:** _Pending Stage 2_

---

### 5. Saeed Anwar (@saen_dev) - ADHD + AI = Productivity Superpower

**Post Link:** https://x.com/saen_dev (4h ago, from search)

**The Tweet:**
About ADHD combined with AI tokens being a productivity superpower for scattered minds.

**Stats:** ~5 likes, 188 views (4h old)

**Opportunity Type:** ADHD audience
**Why This Tweet:**
Perfect intersection of ADHD + AI productivity - exactly BuildOS's target audience. Low engagement means DJ's reply will stand out. This is the kind of small-audience, high-alignment tweet that builds genuine connections.

**Engagement Mode:** Value/Cheerleader - ADHD + AI personal experience

**Replies:** _Pending Stage 2_

---

### 6. Dan Shipper (@danshipper) - 4K Followers Overnight Mystery

**Post Link:** https://x.com/danshipper (4h ago)

**The Tweet:**
About gaining 4,000 followers overnight and being confused about why.

**Stats:** 33 replies, 92 likes (4h old)

**Additional context:** Dan Shipper (90.7K followers) runs Every/Spiral. He's been promoting "Compound Engineering" as competing terminology to "Context Engineering." Also involved with OpenClaw camp.

**Opportunity Type:** Community / Cheerleader
**Why This Tweet:**
Light engagement opportunity. Relationship maintenance with a competitor/adjacent figure. Can be cheerleader mode - congratulate the growth, maybe joke about the mystery. Don't need to bring BuildOS into this.

**Engagement Mode:** Cheerleader - Celebrate the win

**Replies:** _Pending Stage 2_

---

### 7. Claude Code Hackathon - "Built with Opus 4.6"

**Post Link:** @claudeai Feb 6 (reposted by Boris)

**The Tweet:**

> Announcing Built with Opus 4.6: a Claude Code virtual hackathon.
>
> Join the Claude Code team for a week of building. Winners will be hand-selected to win $100K in Claude API credits.

**Opportunity Type:** Community / Building in public
**Why This Tweet:**
DJ should consider ENTERING this hackathon with BuildOS. Even if he doesn't win, participating and building in public about it is great content. Also good engagement opportunity on the announcement itself.

**Engagement Mode:** Cheerleader + potential participant

**Replies:** _Pending Stage 2_

---

## New Accounts Discovered

## Competitor Intelligence

### @bcherny (Boris Cherny) - Claude Code Creator - CRITICAL

**Followers:** 245.4K (down from ~250K est on Feb 5 - possible correction or measurement variance)
**Activity:** Fast mode for Opus 4.6 launch (today!), /rewind feature (23h), hackathon repost
**Key Intel:** Fast mode uses MORE compute but is 2.5x faster. $50 free credit for Pro/Max users, 50% off until Feb 16. Boris personally finds it valuable for "going back and forth with Claude on a tricky problem."
**Implications:** Claude Code continues rapid feature iteration. The team is shipping weekly. This validates BuildOS's bet on Claude as the primary LLM.
**Action:** ENGAGE on fast mode post NOW - it's only ~2h old. Be one of the first thoughtful replies.

### @dexhorthy (Dex) - Context Engineering Pioneer - MAJOR DEVELOPMENT

**Followers:** 11.8K (stable from 11.6K on Feb 3)
**Activity:** Tool calling podcast (21h), Latent Space podcast handoff from swyx (22h), casual posts
**Key Intel:** swyx is handing Dex the Latent Space podcast. This gives Dex (who coined "context engineering") a MASSIVE platform. He'll go from 11.8K followers to potentially 50K+ as podcast host.
**Implications:** Dex becoming Latent Space host means "context engineering" will get even more airtime. BuildOS's positioning is even more validated.
**Action:** Engage on tool calling post. Acknowledge Latent Space move. Deepen relationship before his audience explodes.

### @danshipper (Dan Shipper) - Every/Spiral - Competing Terminology

**Followers:** 90.7K (first measurement)
**Activity:** 4K follower surge (4h ago), "Compound Engineering" framework, OpenClaw camp
**Key Intel:** Dan is pushing "Compound Engineering" as competing terminology to "Context Engineering." His follower surge suggests growing influence.
**Implications:** Competing framework naming. Need to monitor whether "compound engineering" gains traction vs "context engineering."
**Action:** Light engagement. Monitor terminology battle.

### @dannypostma (Danny Postma) - PostmaOS - Still Quiet

**Followers:** 167.7K (first direct measurement - previous was estimated)
**Activity:** Feb 1 last post (UX question about quote tweet flow). Jan 27: "Felt very anxious for a while."
**Bio:** Still "Laying low"
**Implications:** Still on mental health break. PostmaOS development status unclear.
**Action:** Continue monitoring for return.

### @simonw (Simon Willison) - AI Development Thought Leader

**Followers:** 144.7K
**Activity:** "Software Factory" blog post (5h ago, 27K views), $1K/day token cost commentary (2h ago)
**Key Intel:** Writing about fully AI-driven software development where humans don't write OR review code. Highlighting $1K/engineer/day token costs.
**Implications:** The "AI writes everything" approach is gaining mainstream discussion. Token cost concerns are real and tie into fast mode pricing.
**Action:** Engage with real BuildOS/Claude Code development experience.

### @levelsio (Pieter Levels) - Indie Hacker Benchmark

**Followers:** 817.3K (up from 809.6K on Feb 3)
**Activity:** Mostly casual/lifestyle posts. Revenue in bio. Not highly relevant today.
**Action:** Monitor. No engagement opportunity today.

## Strategy Observations

- **Boris just launched fast mode for Opus 4.6** - This is THE engagement opportunity today. Ultra-fresh, Boris asking for feedback, DJ is a daily user.
- **Simon Willison's "Software Factory" post** - The #2 engagement opportunity. AI-first development at scale, token cost discussion. DJ has real experience to share.
- **Dex getting Latent Space podcast** - MAJOR development. The person who coined "context engineering" is about to get a massive platform. Deepen this relationship NOW.
- **Dan Shipper pushing "Compound Engineering"** - Competing terminology to watch. His 4K follower surge suggests growing influence.
- **Claude Code hackathon** - DJ should seriously consider entering with BuildOS. Building in public content opportunity.
- **DJ hasn't posted since Dec 12, 2025** - Follower count declining (258 from 261). Need original content. The hackathon could be the catalyst.
- **ADHD+AI intersection remains underserved** - @saen_dev post is one of the few ADHD+AI takes out there. Opportunity to own this space.
