## Top Engagement Opportunities

### 1. Uri Goren - "Multi Agent Systems Are Hyped" (Score: 94)

**Post Link:** Search "Uri Goren multi agent" on LinkedIn (very recent)
**Author:** Uri Goren | CEO @ Argmax | Search and Discovery with AI
**Age:** ~16m | **Reactions:** 3 | **Comments:** 1

**The Post:**

> Multi agent systems are hyped, why not settle for one good agent? The motivation for multi agent systems is to mimic human organization. You got the heart specialist, you got the skeleton specialist and the admission that routes the patient to the right department. This organization is built around human limitations, namely the amount of information one specialist could hold. Since AI doesn't have this limitation, I don't see why multi hyper specialized agents would be of any help...

**Why This Post:**
PERFECT contrarian AI agents take that aligns directly with DJ's "context > agents" positioning. Extremely fresh with almost zero competition. This is the exact conversation DJ should be in - questioning the agent swarm hype and reframing around context and information management.

**Suggested Comment Option 1 (Value Mode - Context > Agents):**

> This is the conversation I wish more people were having. The multi-agent hype feels like it's solving an organizational problem AI doesn't actually have. What I keep coming back to is that the real bottleneck isn't agent count - it's context. One agent with great context about what you're trying to do outperforms five agents passing fragments back and forth. The limitation isn't intelligence, it's memory and state management across sessions. Have you seen this pattern in your work at Argmax?

**Suggested Comment Option 2 (Value Mode - Curri Experience):**

> Hard agree. I was building integrations at a logistics company (connecting Uber, Lyft, DoorDash APIs) before "AI tool use" was a thing - and the insight was always about giving the right context to select the right tool, not throwing everything at the problem simultaneously. The multi-agent approach mimics organizational dysfunction, not organizational intelligence. Context engineering > agent engineering.

**Suggested Comment Option 3 (Value - Shorter + Question):**

> This is exactly right. The multi-agent rush feels like solving the wrong problem. One agent with deep context beats five agents with shallow context every time. The real bottleneck is memory and state persistence, not parallelism. Curious what you're seeing at Argmax - does better retrieval/context make the multi-agent architecture less necessary?

### 2. Arnav Bansal - Thinko.Space for Neurodivergent People (Score: 92)

**Post Link:** Search "Arnav Bansal Thinko.Space" on LinkedIn
**Author:** Arnav Bansal | Human-Centered AI & Software Developer | ML, Web & Accessibility
**Age:** ~1h | **Reactions:** 0 | **Comments:** 0

**The Post:**

> Thinko.Space - Finalist at Build for Bharat Hackathon. Built in 2025 | Hackathon Finalist. I'm excited to share that my project Thinko.Space was selected as a finalist... [A collection of small, simple, single-task AI tools designed to help neurodivergent people (and everyone else) with tasks they find overwhelming or difficult. Tools: Magic ToDo, Visual Learner, Compiler (Turn a braindump into actions), Focus Timer, Formalizer, Consultant, Estimator, Chef]

**Why This Post:**
The "Compiler - Turn a braindump into actions" tool is LITERALLY adjacent to BuildOS's core feature. This is ADHD/neurodivergent pillar content from a builder in the same space. Fresh with zero engagement - first mover advantage. Great for both cheerleader mode (supporting someone building for neurodivergent users) and value mode (DJ builds in this exact space).

**Suggested Comment Option 1 (Value + Cheerleader):**

> The "Compiler - Turn a braindump into actions" tool caught my eye immediately. I'm building something in this exact space with BuildOS - the core insight that neurodivergent minds need to dump thoughts FIRST and organize AFTER is so underserved by existing tools. Most productivity apps assume you already know what to do and just need to track it. That's backwards for how a lot of brains work. Congrats on the finalist spot - what's been the most surprising user feedback?

**Suggested Comment Option 2 (Cheerleader Mode):**

> This is really cool. The philosophy of small, single-task AI tools for neurodivergent users is exactly right - most productivity tools try to do everything and end up overwhelming the people they're supposed to help. The brain dump to actions feature especially resonates. Congrats on the hackathon placement - rooting for you.

**Suggested Comment Option 3 (Value - Shorter):**

> The "braindump to actions" concept is something I've been obsessing over while building BuildOS. Most tools assume organized input - neurodivergent minds don't work that way. Love seeing more builders in this space. What's the response been from neurodivergent users specifically?

### 3. Carl Parnell - "Stop Fighting Your ADHD Brain" (Score: 88)

**The Post:**

> I spent 20 years touring the world in a metal band. Then I had to get a real job. And I couldn't do it. [Image: "Stop Fighting Your ADHD Brain - Conquer task paralysis, time blindness, and overwhelm - with tools built for your brain." Built by ADHDers, for ADHDers.]

**Why This Post:**
Authentic ADHD founder story from someone building ADHD-specific tools. The "I couldn't do it" vulnerability is genuine and resonant. Low competition. Perfect for cheerleader mode - DJ can relate to the career pivot and the frustration with tools not built for how your brain works.

**Suggested Comment Option 1 (Cheerleader + Value):**

> "Built by ADHDers, for ADHDers" - this is the only way it works. Every productivity tool I tried (Notion, Obsidian, Linear) assumed my brain works in straight lines. It doesn't. That's why I started building my own thing too. The metal band to tech pipeline is way more common than people think - both require obsessive focus and comfort with chaos. What's the #1 feature your ADHD users keep coming back to?

**Suggested Comment Option 2 (Cheerleader Mode):**

> 20 years in a metal band to building ADHD productivity tools is one of the best founder origin stories I've heard. The "I couldn't do it" moment is where the best products come from - building what you desperately need yourself. Rooting for this.

**Suggested Comment Option 3 (Value - Shorter):**

> Task paralysis and time blindness are the real problems nobody's solving well. Most productivity tools make them worse by adding more complexity. Appreciate you building specifically for ADHD brains - following to see where this goes.

### 4. Lenny Rachitsky - "Rise of the Professional Vibe Coder" (Score: 85)

**Post Link:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennyrachitsky/recent-activity/all/
**Author:** Lenny Rachitsky | Deeply researched no-nonsense product, growth, and career advice
**Age:** 2h | **Reactions:** 157 | **Comments:** 13

**The Post:**

> The rise of the professional vibe coder. Lazar Jovanovic is a full-time professional vibe coder at Lovable. He gets paid to vibe-code all day. ...We discuss: Why having no coding background can be a big advantage when building with AI. His markdown file system that keeps AI agents aligned across complex builds. What to do when you get stuck: his 4x4 debugging workflow. Why you should be kicking off 4-5 parallel prototypes. Why design skills, and taste, are going to be the most important skills in the future...

**Why This Post:**
Tier 1 account, very fresh (2h). The "markdown file system that keeps AI agents aligned" point is directly about context engineering - structuring context for AI agents. Low enough comments (13) to still be visible as a Tier 1 post. Great for Value Mode.

**Suggested Comment Option 1 (Value Mode - Context Engineering):**

> "His markdown file system that keeps AI agents aligned across complex builds" - this is the part that matters most and I bet gets overlooked. Everyone focuses on the models getting smarter, but the real unlock is how you structure context for them. A markdown file system IS context engineering. Been finding the same pattern building with Claude Code daily - the quality of your output is determined by the quality of your context, not your prompting skills. Curious about his 4x4 debugging workflow.

**Suggested Comment Option 2 (Value - Building Perspective):**

> The markdown file system angle is what stands out to me. As someone building an AI productivity tool, the biggest insight has been that AI doesn't need better prompts - it needs better context infrastructure. A well-structured markdown file that gives an agent alignment is worth more than a perfectly crafted prompt. Design skills and taste mattering more than coding skills tracks with what I'm seeing too.

**Suggested Comment Option 3 (Cheerleader + Question):**

> "Professional vibe coder" as an actual job title is a sign of the times. The markdown file system for agent alignment is the part I want to dig into most - that's essentially context engineering as a practice. How structured does his system get? Is it more like documentation or more like a codebase architecture?

### 5. Abdul Malik Khudus Shaik - KachowAI "Persistent AI Peer Programmer" (Score: 82)

**Post Link:** LinkedIn feed (1st connection)
**Author:** Abdul Malik Khudus Shaik | AI Engineer | Seeking Full-Time SWE & ML/AI Roles
**Age:** 4h | **Reactions:** 34 | **Comments:** 1

**The Post:**

> Last weekend I built KachowAI - a voice-first AI peer programmer that helps you master LeetCode through conversation, not copying. ...The vision for KachowAI is much bigger: a persistent AI peer programmer that builds with you, not just for you. One that understands your codebase, remembers your patterns, grows with your skills, and feels like a true collaborator, not just another autocomplete.

**Why This Post:**
The "persistent AI...that remembers your patterns, grows with your skills" vision is EXACTLY the BuildOS thesis applied to programming. 1st connection, manageable engagement. "Builds with you, not just for you" is DJ's "thought partner" concept.

**Suggested Comment Option 1 (Value Mode):**

> "A persistent AI peer programmer that builds with you, not just for you. One that understands your codebase, remembers your patterns, grows with your skills" - this is the vision that matters. The current AI tools are incredibly smart but fundamentally amnesiac. Every session starts from zero. I'm building toward a similar philosophy with BuildOS for project management - the core insight is the same: AI that remembers and compounds context beats AI that's smart but stateless. How are you thinking about the persistence/memory layer?

**Suggested Comment Option 2 (Cheerleader + Value):**

> "Builds with you, not just for you" - that framing is perfect. This is the gap I keep seeing across AI tools. They're brilliant in the moment but forget everything the next session. The shift from "AI as autocomplete" to "AI as collaborator that grows with you" is where the real value is. Congrats on the hackathon top 8 - the vision is bigger than the demo and that's exciting.

**Suggested Comment Option 3 (Value - Shorter):**

> The persistence piece is the key. "Remembers your patterns, grows with your skills" solves the real problem - AI has amnesia. Building toward the same philosophy in a different space. The models are smart enough already. Context and memory are the unlock.

**The Post:**

> I finally decided to read this and I'm really glad I did. A few takeaways... 1. Two weeks and $20k to build a complex system is a big deal! 2. This appears to have required a significant amount of planning, experimentation, testing, and AI expertise. 3. The final resulting code is somewhat incomplete and suboptimal. 4. This is all possible through incremental improvements to the ecosystem... [Shares Anthropic article: Building a C compiler with a team of parallel Claudes]

**Why This Post:**
1st connection, fellow veteran, and a thoughtful take on agentic AI capabilities vs limitations. Zero comments - great for engagement. The "significant amount of planning, experimentation" and "incomplete and suboptimal" observations connect to DJ's "context engineering matters" thesis.

**Suggested Comment Option 1 (Value Mode):**

> Point #2 is the one that doesn't get enough attention - "significant amount of planning, experimentation, testing, and AI expertise." The narrative is "AI builds things autonomously" but the reality is someone still needs to architect the context and structure for the agents. That's the part that matters and doesn't scale as easily as people hope. $20k and 2 weeks with expert supervision is impressive, but also tells you where the real bottleneck is - it's not model intelligence, it's context engineering.

**Suggested Comment Option 2 (Cheerleader + Value):**

> Great synthesis. The tension between #1 (impressive!) and #3 (still incomplete) is where the real story is. We're at the stage where AI can do remarkable things with the right context and planning, but can't reliably do them on its own. The gap is context and orchestration, not intelligence. Appreciate you breaking this down honestly instead of just hype.

**Suggested Comment Option 3 (Value - Shorter):**

> "#4 - this literally was not possible 6 months ago" combined with "#3 - somewhat incomplete and suboptimal" tells the whole story. The models are accelerating fast but the context/planning layer is still the bottleneck. That's the interesting problem right now.

**The Post:**

> i've tried a lot of angles on this - my latest thoughts "how do i get AI adoption in my org" [Framework diagram showing: Process -> Measurement -> Social Proof -> Qualitative Success (Good Code/Shipping) + Quantitative Success (Blowing Metrics). Without Social Proof path leads to Unproductive Qualitative Debates.]

**Why This Post:**
Dexter Horthy coined "Context Engineering." Relationship building priority. The framework about AI adoption through social proof before measurement is a practical, non-hype take. Lower score because it's 2d old and already has 7 comments, but important for maintaining the connection.

**Suggested Comment Option 1 (Value Mode):**

> The "social proof before measurement" insight is sharp. I've seen the "unproductive qualitative debates" path firsthand - people arguing about whether AI is good enough instead of just showing it working. At Curri, the same pattern played out with any new tool integration - the teams that adopted fastest were the ones where someone just started using it and showed results, not the ones waiting for a formal evaluation. Process -> measurement without social proof is dead on arrival.

**Suggested Comment Option 2 (Cheerleader + Question):**

> "Without social proof -> unproductive qualitative debates" - this is the trap I see everywhere. People debate AI capabilities in the abstract instead of just shipping something and showing it works. The framework is clean. Curious - does the same pattern hold for individual adoption (like a solo developer)? Or is social proof specifically an organizational unlock?

**Suggested Comment Option 3 (Value - Shorter):**

> The social proof step is the unlock most people skip. They go straight from "process" to "measurement" and end up in exactly the debates you describe. Showing > telling. Appreciate you keeping this practical instead of theoretical - matches what I've seen in the trenches.

## Notable Signal: "Context Engineering" Entering Mainstream

Lenny Rachitsky's 5d post (647 reactions, 73 comments) casually mentions "context engineering" and "RAG" as terms people nod along to in meetings without understanding them. This suggests the term is gaining mainstream awareness beyond just practitioners. Worth monitoring - as "context engineering" becomes more mainstream, DJ's positioning strengthens.

### Two Modes

1. **Value Mode** - When you have experience/insight: Share specific experience, lead with curiosity, "What I'm finding..." not "The answer is..."
2. **Cheerleader Mode** - When you don't: Genuine excitement, specific praise, curious questions, "We're all rowing the same boat" energy

### The 3 Quality Tests

1. Can I visualize it? (Specific details)
2. Can I falsify it? (Real experience)
3. Can nobody else say this? (Unique perspective from BuildOS, Curri, Marines)

### LinkedIn-Specific

- Longer, more nuanced than Twitter
- Professional but authentic
- Learning voice, not authoritative
- 2-4 sentence comments minimum
- Ask questions to open dialogue
- Saturday = lower competition, good day to engage
