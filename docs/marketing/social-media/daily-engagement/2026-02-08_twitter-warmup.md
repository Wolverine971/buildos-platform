## Tweet Opportunities

### 1. Dex (@dexhorthy) - "Happy Sunday to All Who Ship"

**Post Link:** https://x.com/dexhorthy (2h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> happy sunday to all who ship

**Stats:** 0 replies, 0 RTs, 8 likes, 532 views (2h old - ULTRA FRESH)

**Opportunity Type:** Community / Building in public
**Why This Tweet:**
BEST opportunity today. ZERO replies on a post from the person who coined "context engineering." Dex is building "the post-IDE IDE" at hlyr.dev/code. He's about to take over Latent Space podcast (noted Feb 7). First reply on a Saturday morning post from a 11.8K follower account that's about to explode in influence. Perfect cheerleader + subtle "fellow builder" signal.

**Engagement Mode:** Cheerleader - Fellow builder shipping on a Saturday

**Replies:** _Pending Stage 2_

---

### 2. Levelsio (@levelsio) - AGI Urgency + Start Now

**Post Link:** https://x.com/levelsio (15m ago at scan)

**The Tweet:**

> The question is do you have time to wait a few more years before starting a business. I don't believe in scarcity normally but it might be time to really go for it NOW considering all things AGI

**Stats:** 17 replies, 1 RT, 69 likes, 3.6K views (15m old - ULTRA FRESH)

**Opportunity Type:** Building in public / Indie hacker
**Why This Tweet:**
ULTRA FRESH from the indie hacker GOAT (817K+ followers). The "start NOW because AGI" angle directly maps to DJ's decision to leave Curri and build BuildOS. Low reply count at 17 means there's still room. This is a building-in-public engagement opportunity.

**Engagement Mode:** Value - DJ literally quit his job to build NOW

**Replies:** _Pending Stage 2_

---

### 3. Boris Cherny (@bcherny) - Fast Mode Opus 4.6 (Still Growing)

**Post Link:** https://x.com/bcherny (23h ago)

**The Tweet (thread):**

Post 1:

> We just launched an experimental new fast mode for Opus 4.6. The team has been building with it for the last few weeks. It's been a huge unlock for me personally, especially when going back and forth with Claude on a tricky problem.

(Quote tweeting @claudeai: "Our teams have been building with a 2.5x-faster version of Claude Opus 4.6. We're now making it available as an early experiment via Claude Code and our API.")

Post 2:

> Use /fast to enable. It uses a lot more compute than Opus 4.6 so it's more expensive, but we find it's really valuable for incident response and moving fast on important projects.

Post 3:

> Excited to hear what you think! Pro & Max users have $50 in free credit to try it out, and it's 50% off until Feb 16.

**Stats (Updated from yesterday):**

- Post 1: 129 replies, 96 RTs, 1.6K likes, **239K views** (was 25K yesterday - 10x growth!)
- Post 2: 14 replies, 12 RTs, 374 likes, 49K views
- Post 3: 48 replies, 11 RTs, 442 likes, 42K views

**Opportunity Type:** AI reality check / Community
**Why This Tweet:**
Still growing massively - went from 25K to 239K views overnight. Boris is still asking for feedback. DJ uses Claude Code daily with Opus 4.6 - perfect authentic engagement. At 23h and 129 replies it's getting crowded but the visibility is enormous.

**Engagement Mode:** Value - Real experience with Opus 4.6 fast mode

**Replies:** _Pending Stage 2_

---

### 4. Pneuma (@scaryinference) - ADHD + Claude Evening Productivity

**Post Link:** https://x.com/scaryinference (23h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> i was diagnosed ADHD since i was 6years old. i was always biased, that evening productivity&focus spikes are connected with adhd somehow. claude tells me almost same as research, when i asked "why i can easily focus at evening and its hard to focus at day?"

**Stats:** 0 replies, 0 RTs, 43 likes, 3.8K views

**Opportunity Type:** ADHD audience / AI reality check
**Why This Tweet:**
Perfect ADHD + AI intersection. Someone using Claude to understand their own ADHD patterns - exactly BuildOS's target audience. The evening productivity spike is a relatable ADHD experience. Zero replies means DJ's reply will be the first and most visible. Smaller account but high alignment.

**Engagement Mode:** Value/Cheerleader - ADHD + AI personal experience, relatable

**Replies:** _Pending Stage 2_

---

### 5. Simon Willison (repost of @mitchellh) - "Vouch" Trust Management for OSS

**Post Link:** https://x.com/simonw (repost, 21h ago)

**The Tweet (by Mitchell Hashimoto @mitchellh):**
About "Vouch" - a trust management system for open source software.

**Stats:** 172 replies, 352 RTs, 3K likes, **341K views**

**Opportunity Type:** AI reality check / Community
**Why This Tweet:**
Trust management for OSS is adjacent to context engineering - how do you give AI agents the right context about which code to trust? Mitchell Hashimoto (Terraform/Vagrant creator) is a huge figure. 341K views = massive visibility. Simon reposted it, showing his endorsement.

**Engagement Mode:** Value - Trust/context angle for AI-assisted development

**Replies:** _Pending Stage 2_

---

### 6. Dex (@dexhorthy) - AITinkerers SF Unhackathon

**Post Link:** https://x.com/dexhorthy (20h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> AITinkerers SF @openclaw unhackathon was a blast - No vendors, no sponsors, no credits, no pitches, just builders building and learning from each other

**Stats:** ~50 likes, ~3K views (20h old)

**Opportunity Type:** Community / Context Engineering
**Why This Tweet:**
The "no vendors, no sponsors, just builders" ethos maps perfectly to BuildOS's builder-first philosophy. Dex at the OpenClaw unhackathon shows he's deepening ties with the Every/Compound Engineering ecosystem. Good relationship maintenance opportunity.

**Engagement Mode:** Cheerleader - Celebrate the builder community ethos

**Replies:** _Pending Stage 2_

## Competitor Intelligence

### @bcherny (Boris Cherny) - Claude Code Creator

**Followers:** 246.7K (up from 245.4K yesterday, +1.3K overnight)
**Activity:** Fast mode thread still growing (239K views, up from 25K). /rewind post at 129K views (up from 114K).
**Implications:** Claude Code continues dominating the AI dev tools conversation. Fast mode at 2.5x speed validates the tool as production-grade.
**Action:** Engage on fast mode thread - still active.

### @dexhorthy (Dex) - Context Engineering Pioneer

**Followers:** 11.8K (stable)
**Bio Update:** Now says "building the post-IDE IDE at hlyr.dev/code"
**Activity:** "happy sunday to all who ship" (2h, 0 replies), AITinkerers SF unhackathon recap (20h), reposted Jessie Frazelle on agent usage
**Key Intel:** Building hlyr.dev/code (post-IDE IDE). Still deeply embedded in the builder community. OpenClaw unhackathon ties him closer to Every ecosystem.
**Implications:** Dex building an IDE product could make him a potential integration partner or competitor depending on direction. His Latent Space podcast takeover (noted Feb 7) will amplify his platform significantly.
**Action:** Engage on "happy sunday" post NOW - first reply opportunity. Maintain relationship.

### @danshipper (Dan Shipper) - Every/Spiral - Compound Engineering

**Followers:** 91.4K (up from 90.7K yesterday, +700 overnight)
**Activity:** Mostly reposts today - @backseats_eth praising Every's approach, @every promoting Kieran Klaassen's compound engineering plugin, Ali Romman's OpenClaw Camp recap. Pinned: Agent-Native Architecture guide (375K views, up from earlier).
**Key Intel:** Dan is aggressively promoting "Compound Engineering" as a framework. The plugin by @kieranklaassen is getting user praise (@23rdletters called the research agent "crazy"). OpenClaw Camp generating positive buzz.
**Implications:** Compound Engineering gaining real traction as competing framework to Context Engineering. Plugin adoption = moat building. Dan's follower surge continues.
**Action:** Monitor. No direct engagement opportunity today. Watch CE vs Compound Engineering terminology battle.

### @dannypostma (Danny Postma) - PostmaOS - Still Quiet

**Followers:** 167.8K (up from 167.7K - barely changed)
**Bio:** Still "Laying low"
**Activity:** Last post Feb 1. No new content.
**Implications:** Still on mental health break. PostmaOS development status unclear.
**Action:** Continue monitoring for return.

### @simonw (Simon Willison) - AI Development Thought Leader

**Followers:** 144.9K (up from 144.7K yesterday)
**Activity:** Personal posts (kakapo mug, DRAM/fiber optic joke), reposted Mitchell Hashimoto's "Vouch" (341K views). Software Factory post from Feb 7 now at 75K views (up from 27K).
**Implications:** Simon's "Software Factory" post continues growing. Mitchell Hashimoto's Vouch = trust management for OSS is an emerging topic.
**Action:** Consider engaging on Vouch repost for trust/context angle.

### @DataChaz (Charly Wargnier) - OpenClaw/Clawbot

**Followers:** 154.4K (first measurement)
**Bio:** "Clawbot / @openclaw tinkerer - Ex @Streamlit @Snowflake"
**Activity:** OpenAI Super Bowl ad drama (57m, 5.6K views). Mostly news/entertainment today.
**Key Intel:** Charly appeared in DJ's notifications. Part of the OpenClaw/Every ecosystem. 154K followers is significant.
**Implications:** Large AI community account. Worth tracking as potential engagement target for AI content days.
**Action:** No strong engagement opportunity today. Note for future.

## Strategy Observations

- **Dex "happy sunday to all who ship" = #1 opportunity** - 0 replies, first-reply on the CE pioneer, Saturday morning, relationship maintenance before his platform explodes with Latent Space
- **Levelsio AGI urgency = #2 opportunity** - ultra fresh, maps perfectly to DJ's founder story
- **Boris fast mode thread went 10x overnight** (25K -> 239K views) - still worth engaging but 129 replies means crowded
- **ADHD + Claude intersection emerging** - @scaryinference using Claude to understand ADHD patterns is exactly BuildOS's thesis audience
- **Compound Engineering gaining traction** - Dan Shipper's plugin getting real user praise, follower surge continues (+700 overnight)
- **Vibe Coding trending** (940 posts) - but no single ideal engagement target
- **Mitchell Hashimoto's Vouch** (341K views) - trust management for OSS is an interesting context engineering adjacent topic
- **Saturday morning** - less competition for engagement, good timing for first-reply opportunities
- **DJ hasn't posted since Dec 12, 2025** - follower count likely still declining. Need original content soon.
