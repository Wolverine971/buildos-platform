## Voice Reminder

### The Philosophy
**Interesting guy + cheerleader. NOT a thought leader.**

### Two Modes
1. **Value Mode:** When you have experience to share - lead with insight, be specific, ask smart questions
2. **Cheerleader Mode:** When you don't - genuine hype, curious questions, celebrate their wins

### The 3 Rules (for Value Mode)
1. Can I visualize it? (specific details)
2. Can I falsify it? (real experience)
3. Can nobody else say this? (unique perspective)

### Quick Do's
- Genuine excitement when cheering someone on
- "hell yes" and specific praise for wins
- Curious questions about their journey
- Teammate energy - we're all rowing together

### Quick Don'ts
- "love this" or "great post" (hollow)
- Preachy setups ("Most people don't realize...")
- Generic observations anyone could make
- Teaching when you're just supporting
- Thought leader energy
