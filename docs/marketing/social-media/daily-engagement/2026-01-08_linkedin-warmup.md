## Top Engagement Opportunities

### 1. Aftab Hussain - "Memory is the Next Hurdle in AI Engineering" ⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY

**Author:** Aftab Hussain | AI Agent Developer • AI Automation Engineer • LLM Engineer
**Posted:** ~5 minutes ago
**Reactions:** 1
**Comments:** 0
**Source:** "context engineering AI" search
**Post Link:** https://www.linkedin.com/posts/aftab-hussain120_ai-langchain-langgraph-activity-7415100540009025536-FmoA/

**Post Summary:**
"Why 'Memory' is the next hurdle in AI Engineering 🧠

I've spent the day diving deep into LangGraph Persistence and the role..."

Shows code snippets using `langgraph.checkpoint.memory` and `InMemorySaver`.

**Why Engage:**

- ZERO comments = first mover advantage
- Directly about AI memory - BuildOS's core positioning
- Technical post from practitioner
- Perfect for "context > agents" angle
- Extremely fresh = algorithm boost

**Comment Options:**

**Option A (Experience + Question - Recommended):**

```
been hitting this same wall. spent months pasting the same project docs into Claude every session before I realized that's the actual work.

curious about InMemorySaver for longer-running sessions - are you finding it holds up, or does it get stale as the conversation drifts?
```

**Option B (Builder Angle):**

```
this is exactly the problem I'm trying to solve with BuildOS. the AI is plenty smart - it just forgets everything between sessions.

are you finding persistence alone is enough? or do you still need to inject context explicitly even with the checkpoint system?
```

**Option C (Shorter/Direct):**

```
yes. the memory gap is the whole thing.

I've tried markdown files, pasting docs, custom instructions - nothing sticks the way you'd expect. curious how InMemorySaver handles context that spans multiple days?
```

### 2. Riddhi Kaul - Salesforce AI Agents Limitations ⭐ PERFECT CONTRARIAN

**Author:** Riddhi Kaul | Experienced management consultant and corporate strategist
**Posted:** ~1 minute ago (Edited)
**Reactions:** 0
**Comments:** 0
**Source:** "AI agents autonomous" search
**Substack:** "Issue #18: Salesforce's AI Lessons and Why Small Models Are a Big Deal"
**Post Link:** https://www.linkedin.com/posts/riddhikaul_issue-18-salesforces-ai-lessons-and-why-activity-7415102189733384192-qT49/

**Post Summary:**
"#Salesforce's recent experience with AI agents is instructive. It's a reminder that while autonomous AI sounds powerful, making it reliable in real business workflows is so far, hard. In practice, many teams are stepping back..."

**Why Engage:**

- ZERO engagement = ground floor opportunity
- Already making the "agents aren't ready" argument
- Perfect setup for "context > agents" contrarian take
- Links to thoughtful Substack analysis
- Fresh post, engaged author

**Comment Options:**

**Option A (Experience-Based - Recommended):**

```
been seeing the same thing. at Curri we were connecting APIs (Uber, Lyft, DoorDash) before "AI tool use" was trendy - and even then the hard part was never the integration. it was making sure the system knew which tool to use when.

agents without that context just make expensive mistakes faster.

curious what "stepping back" looks like for the teams you're seeing - more human-in-the-loop, or rethinking the architecture?
```

**Option B (Builder Angle):**

```
this matches what I'm finding building in this space. the agents themselves work fine - until they don't have enough context about the business to make good decisions.

the Salesforce example is perfect. autonomy sounds great until the agent doesn't know what happened yesterday.

what's your read on small models vs the architecture problem?
```

**Option C (Shorter/Curious):**

```
appreciate the realistic take. most of what I see is hype without the caveats.

curious - in the teams that are "stepping back," are they adding more human checkpoints or fundamentally rethinking how the agent gets context?
```

### 3. Lenny Rachitsky - AI Improves Quality, Not Just Productivity ⭐ TIER 1

**Author:** Lenny Rachitsky | Deeply researched product, growth, and career advice
**Posted:** ~1 hour ago
**Reactions:** 72
**Comments:** 31
**Reposts:** 2
**Source:** Tier 1 account scan
**Post Link:** https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lennyrachitsky_one-of-the-biggest-surprises-in-our-newsletter-activity-7415080715270410240-9DM6/

**Post Summary:**
"One of the biggest surprises in our newsletter AI survey is how many people reported that AI improved the _quality_ of their work (not just their productivity).

Quality impact - How AI changes perceived quality across roles:

- 69% of all respondents say AI improved quality output
- Product Managers: 73.2% better
- Engineers: 50.7% better
- Designers: 60.6% better
- Founders: 74.9% better"

**Why Engage:**

- TIER 1 account with massive reach
- Only 31 comments - still room to stand out
- 1 hour old - within prime engagement window
- Quality vs productivity angle aligns with BuildOS philosophy
- Founders segment (74.9%) is your target audience

**Comment Options:**

**Option A (Experience + Question - Recommended):**

```
the founder number (74.9%) makes sense to me. been using Claude Code daily and the quality improvement is real - but not because it's faster. it's because it catches things I'd miss when I'm moving too fast.

curious if the survey got into *how* people felt quality improved - better first drafts, catching blind spots, or something else?
```

**Option B (Shorter/Direct):**

```
interesting that quality beats speed. tracks with what I'm seeing - the best use of AI isn't doing more faster, it's thinking more clearly.

that 74.9% founder number is wild. probably reflects using it as a thought partner vs just task automation.
```

**Option C (Cheerleader + Curious):**

```
the quality vs productivity framing is good. most of the conversation is about speed.

did anything in the responses surprise you? feels like the founder segment might be using AI differently than the others.
```

### 4. Chris McKenzie - AI as Power Tool, Context Required

**Author:** Chris McKenzie | Software Engineer at Facebook
**Posted:** ~3 minutes ago
**Reactions:** 2
**Comments:** 0
**Source:** "context engineering AI" search
**Post Link:** https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chris-mckenzie-b595155_my-experience-with-ai-in-software-engineering-activity-7415100961708298241-hGK8/

**Post Summary:**
"My experience with AI in software engineering so far is that it is a power tool. It's faster to use a power drill than to drill by hand, but the developer still needs to bring the context of why we're drilling in the first place. AI has been..."

**Why Engage:**

- Zero comments = first mover
- "Context" framing aligns perfectly with BuildOS
- Fresh post with early traction
- Power tool analogy is memorable
- Facebook engineer = credible voice

**Comment Options:**

**Option A (Experience + Agreement - Recommended):**

```
the power tool framing is good. been using Claude Code daily and the difference between "here's a task" vs "here's a task + my project files + what I'm trying to accomplish" is night and day.

same model, same prompt - completely different results based on context.

how are you deciding what context to feed it vs what to let it figure out?
```

**Option B (Builder Angle):**

```
"the developer still needs to bring the context" - yes. this is exactly what I'm building toward with BuildOS.

the AI is plenty capable. the bottleneck is getting it the right information. most bad AI output is actually a context problem, not a capability problem.
```

**Option C (Shorter/Curious):**

```
this. the blame usually goes to the model when it's really a context problem.

curious - are you feeding it project-specific context manually, or have you found a way to automate that?
```

### 5. "IRON" Mike Steadman - Radical Focus ⭐ VET FOUNDER ANGLE

**Author:** "IRON" Mike Steadman | Category Designer & Venture Partner | #VeteranEntrepreneurs
**Posted:** 53 minutes ago
**Connection:** 1st degree
**Source:** LinkedIn Feed
**Tags:** #VeteranEntrepreneurs
**Post Link:** https://www.linkedin.com/posts/iron-mike-steadman_the-theme-for-the-next-90-days-is-radical-activity-7415089296283619329-OZXJ/

**Post Summary:**
"The theme for the next 90 days is 'Radical Focus.'"

**Why Engage:**

- 1st degree connection from yesterday's engagement
- #VeteranEntrepreneurs tag = perfect for DJ's Marine background
- "Radical Focus" theme aligns with productivity/clarity pillar
- Building ongoing relationship with relevant founder
- Low comment count = room to be seen

**Comment Options:**

**Option A (Vet + Curious - Recommended):**

```
love this. the Marines taught me to lock in for long stretches, but translating that to building a company is a different skill entirely.

what's driving the 90-day sprint - shipping something specific, or more about establishing the habit?
```

**Option B (Cheerleader + Question):**

```
let's go. 90 days of radical focus.

curious what you're focusing ON - one big thing, or a handful of priorities? the "focus on one thing" advice sounds good but rarely matches how founder life actually works.
```

**Option C (Shorter/Direct):**

```
the hardest part is deciding what NOT to focus on. everything feels important when you're building.

what made you pick 90 days?
```

### 6. Sean Emory - AI Sales Agents (Optional)

**Author:** Sean Emory | Founder & CIO at Avory & Co. | Investing where the world...
**Posted:** ~1 minute ago

**Post Link:** https://www.linkedin.com/posts/seanemoryavory_heard-a-podcast-on-the-plane-where-a-well-known-activity-7415102245832450048-hi35/

**Post Summary:**
"Heard a podcast on the plane where a well-known technologist said they stopped hiring inside sales reps and built AI sales agents instead..."

**Why Engage:**

- Fresh post about AI agents in business
- Lower priority - more tangential to core pillars
- Could be good for contrarian agent take if time allows

**Comment Option (If Time):**

```
curious what the actual implementation looks like. in my experience, agents without context about the customer history don't close - they just scale the mistakes.

did they share any details on how it's working? or just the headline?
```

## Voice Reminder

### The 3 Rules

1. Can I visualize it? (Specific details, not abstractions)
2. Can I falsify it? (Real experience you could defend)
3. Can nobody else say this? (Use your unique experience)

### Today's Best Angles

- **Context > Agents** - Aftab, Riddhi, Sean posts are perfect for this
- **Curri integrations** - Relevant to tool use/context discussions
- **Clarity > Speed** - Lenny's quality finding supports this
- **Vet founder** - Mike Steadman connection

### Mode Check Before Each Comment

- Do I have expertise/experience here? → **Value Mode**
- Am I just supporting someone's journey? → **Cheerleader Mode**
- Both are valid. Pick the right one.
