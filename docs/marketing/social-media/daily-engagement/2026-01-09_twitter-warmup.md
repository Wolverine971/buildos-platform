## 1. Dex Horthy - "Shipped Value" vs "Spent Tokens" (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Post Link:** https://x.com/dexhorthy (14h ago post)

**The Tweet:**

> So much "I spent $$ tokens" so little "I shipped $$ value"

**Stats:** ~10.5K followers, growing fast

**Why This Tweet:**
@dexhorthy COINED "context engineering" - this is YOUR term's originator. This tweet cuts to the heart of the builder vs experimenter divide. Perfect for DJ's "blue collar software engineering" angle. His audience is your audience.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Builder solidarity - Recommended):**

> this is the whole game. the twitter timeline is full of "look how many tokens i burned" and empty on "here's what i shipped."

> been tracking my claude code usage. the sessions that matter aren't the long ones - they're the ones where i had the right context loaded first.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Direct insight):**

> the token burn flex is the new "10x engineer working 80 hours" flex.

> real output comes from context quality, not context quantity. better prep = fewer tokens = more shipped.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Short + punchy):**

> spending tokens is easy. shipping value requires the context work nobody wants to do.

## 2. Lenny Rachitsky - AI Startup Opportunities (HIGHLY RELEVANT)

**Post Link:** https://x.com/lennysan (15h ago post)

**The Tweet:**

> What are the biggest opportunities for AI startups today?

**Stats:** Massive engagement - Lenny has 500K+ followers, this will get hundreds of replies

**Why This Tweet:**
This is a direct invitation to share your thesis. Lenny is THE product leader on Twitter. Getting noticed here = huge visibility. The question is open-ended enough for your context engineering angle.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Direct thesis - Recommended):**

> the unglamorous infrastructure layer: context that persists across sessions.

> every AI tool right now has amnesia. users re-explain themselves constantly. the startup that solves "AI that actually remembers my project" wins.

> not as sexy as agents. way more valuable.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Pattern observation):**

> seeing the same pain point everywhere: AI tools that are brilliant in isolation, useless in context.

> the opportunity isn't smarter models - it's context infrastructure. the plumbing that lets AI actually compound what it knows about you.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Shorter):**

> context infrastructure. AI has an amnesia problem. every session starts from zero. whoever solves persistent project context wins the next decade.

## 3. Rafael Mendiola - Context Engineering Evolution (VERY FRESH)

**Post Link:** https://x.com/GroundControl (1h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> Didn't even bother to try it, the key insight is to try to put the agent on a loop. So the skill set is becoming:
>
> Prompt engineering -> context engineering -> agent loop engineering

(Quote tweeting @nateberkopec about agent observability challenges)

**Stats:** Fresh post, low engagement - opportunity to be early

**Why This Tweet:**
This progression framework is EXACTLY your thesis evolution. You can validate and extend it. Being early on a fresh post with a smart reply = visibility.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Validate + extend - Recommended):**

> this progression is real. been living it.

> the jump from prompt engineering to context engineering was "what do i feed the model." the jump to agent loop engineering is "what does the model retain between loops."

> memory becomes the bottleneck at every step.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Experience-based):**

> seeing this exact progression in my daily claude code usage.

> started with prompting. then realized the magic was in the markdown files i prepared. now realizing the real unlock is what persists session to session.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Question to engage):**

> love this framework. curious where you think "harness engineering" (dexhorthy's term) fits? feels like the integration layer between context and loops.

## 4. Simon Willison - AI Predictions 2026 (HIGH ENGAGEMENT)

**Post Link:** https://x.com/simonw/status/... (18h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> I joined the Oxide and Friends annual predictions podcast episode this week - here are my 1, 3 and 6 year predictions for AI and LLMs (and Kākāpō parrots)
>
> Predictions include:
>
> - 1 year: "Challenger disaster" for coding agent security
> - 3 years: Jevons paradox for software engineering will resolve
> - 6 years: Typing code by hand will go the way of punch cards

**Stats:** 16 replies, 20 RTs, 139 likes, 29K views

**Why This Tweet:**
Simon is highly respected (Django co-creator). The "Challenger disaster for agent security" prediction is a perfect hook for context engineering - agents acting without proper context = security risk. High engagement means your reply can get visibility.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Safety angle - Recommended):**

> the "challenger disaster" prediction hits. and i think the root cause will be context, not capability.

> agents smart enough to execute but not enough context to know when they shouldn't. intelligence without memory = dangerous.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Jevons paradox angle):**

> the jevons paradox prediction is interesting. my bet: it resolves toward "more coding overall, different kind of coding."

> less typing syntax, more preparing context. the skill shifts from "write code" to "feed the model what it needs to write good code."

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Short + curious):**

> the challenger disaster prediction is haunting. curious what you think the failure mode looks like - is it capability without guardrails, or capability without context?

## 5. Shaan Puri - Common Sense Meetings (TIER 1)

**Post Link:** https://x.com/ShaanVP (12h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> Common sense meetings (thread about meeting practices)

**Stats:** 43 replies, ~114 likes

**Why This Tweet:**
Tier 1 account, always engage. Meeting efficiency is adjacent to productivity - not your core territory but good for visibility. Be a cheerleader here unless you have specific experience.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Cheerleader mode - Recommended):**

> the "meetings with no agenda should be social" distinction is underrated. so many "meetings" are actually just hanging out pretending to work.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Add experience):**

> learned this the hard way at a startup: every meeting without a decision to make is a meeting that should have been a loom.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Short):**

> "no agenda = social hangout" - stealing this framing.

## 6. Dan Shipper - "Dropping Something Heavy" Teaser

**Post Link:** https://x.com/danshipper (13h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> dropping something heavy tomorrow

**Stats:** Teaser post, moderate engagement

**Why This Tweet:**
Dan is in your direct competitor space (Every, AI productivity). This teaser suggests a product announcement. MONITOR for the actual drop tomorrow. Today's engagement should be cheerleader mode - genuine curiosity.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Curious cheerleader - Recommended):**

> 👀 following

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Genuine interest):**

> been enjoying the every content. curious what's coming.

## Posting Strategy

**Recommended Order:**

1. **@dexhorthy "shipped value"** - POST FIRST (he's the context engineering originator)
2. **@GroundControl progression** - Within 30 min (very fresh, be early)
3. **@lennysan AI opportunities** - HIGH VISIBILITY, take your time on this one
4. **@simonw predictions** - Good engagement, differentiated angle
5. **@ShaanVP meetings** - Cheerleader mode, keep it short

**Timing Notes:**

- Space replies 30+ min apart
- @GroundControl post is only 1h old - early engagement matters
- @lennysan will have tons of replies - make yours stand out with specifics
- Don't mention BuildOS in every reply - 1-2 natural mentions max

## Voice Reminder

### The Philosophy

**Interesting guy + cheerleader. NOT a thought leader.**

### Two Modes

1. **Value Mode:** When you have experience to share
    - Specific details from using Claude Code daily
    - Context engineering observations
    - Solo founder journey

2. **Cheerleader Mode:** When you don't
    - Genuine curiosity and questions
    - "hell yes" energy for wins
    - Celebrate their insights specifically

### The 3 Rules (for Value Mode)

1. **Can I visualize it?** - Specific details, not abstractions
2. **Can I falsify it?** - Real experience you could defend
3. **Can nobody else say this?** - Use Marines (sparingly), solo founder, Claude Code daily user

### Quick Don'ts

- No "love this" or "great post" (hollow)
- No "this resonated" (generic)
- No preachy teaching when supporting
- Don't make it about you when cheering
