## Tweet Opportunities

### 1. Dex (@dexhorthy) - PR Alignment via Markdown Docs (BEST OPPORTUNITY)

**Post Link:** https://x.com/dexhorthy (1h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> everyone's fighting PR slop and its like, well if you spend 10 minutes getting alignment on a 200 line markdown doc (ai assisted ofc) then you reduce PR rework by 80-90% cause its correct the first time

**Follow-up (1h):**

> okay sometimes it takes more than 10 minutes but a minute spent in design/architecture is worth 10-100 minutes of code review time

**Stats:** 7 replies, 3 RTs, 21 likes, 1.3K views (1h old - ULTRA FRESH)
**Follow-up stats:** 0 replies, 3 likes, 221 views

**Opportunity Type:** Context Engineering / Building in public
**Why This Tweet:**
BEST opportunity today. Dex is talking about using markdown docs for alignment before coding - this is EXACTLY what CLAUDE.md files do in Claude Code, and EXACTLY what BuildOS's context engineering thesis is about. DJ literally uses this workflow daily: write context docs, give AI the context, get correct output first time. Only 7 replies on a 1h post from the person who coined "context engineering." First-reply quality opportunity on a Sunday morning.

**Engagement Mode:** Value - Real CLAUDE.md experience reducing PR rework

**Replies:** _Pending Stage 2_

---

### 2. Aakash Gupta (@aakashgupta) - Context Engineering > Prompt Engineering (FIRST REPLY OPPORTUNITY)

**Post Link:** https://x.com/aakashgupta/status/2020918116276908136 (20m ago)

**The Tweet:**

> The biggest misconception in the AI productivity space right now: people think prompt engineering is the skill that matters.
>
> It's context engineering.
>
> OpenAI's own research team published findings showing that retrieval-augmented generation (adding relevant context) improves output quality 3-4x more than prompt optimization on the same base model. Anthropic's internal benchmarks tell a similar story.
>
> When a PM writes "draft a PRD for a notification preferences feature," the model quality depends almost entirely on what context is available, not how cleverly the prompt is worded.
>
> A mediocre prompt with rich context produces better output than a perfect prompt with no context. Every time.
>
> This is why the PMs getting 10x value from Claude Code aren't the ones writing elaborate prompts. They're the ones who spent 2-3 hours loading their business context, stakeholder dynamics, competitive landscape, and working preferences into a persistent context library.
>
> The skill that separates productive AI users from frustrated ones is the willingness to over-share context, not the ability to craft clever instructions.

(Quoting his own Feb 6 post about AI PM tools market)

**Stats:** 0 replies, 1 RT, 4 likes, 946 views (20m old - ULTRA FRESH)

**Opportunity Type:** Context Engineering / AI reality check
**Why This Tweet:**
INCREDIBLE first-reply opportunity. Aakash Gupta runs product-growth.com ($46K/mo), landpmjob.com ($32K/mo) - major PM influencer. He's literally describing what CLAUDE.md files do: "persistent context library." His thesis about context > prompts is EXACTLY what DJ does daily building BuildOS. ZERO replies on a 20-minute-old post. The PM audience overlap is perfect - these are the people who need BuildOS. First reply will be most visible as this post grows.

**Engagement Mode:** Value - Real CLAUDE.md / context library experience

**Replies:** _Pending Stage 2_

### 3. Simon Willison (@simonw) - AI Burnout / "AI Doesn't Reduce Work"

**Post Link:** https://x.com/simonw (1h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> Interesting research in HBR today about how the productivity boost you can get from AI tools can lead to burnout or general metal exhaustion, something I've noticed in my own work

(Links to simonwillison.net: "AI Doesn't Reduce Work—It Intensifies It" by Aruna Ranganathan and Xingqi Maggie Ye from Berkeley Haas)

**Follow-up (49m):**

> Here's that HBR story in full

(Links to hbr.org)

**Stats:** 26 replies, 41 RTs, 208 likes, 17K views (1h old)
**Follow-up:** 1 reply, 1 RT, 14 likes, 2.6K views

**Opportunity Type:** AI reality check / Contrarian
**Why This Tweet:**
STRONG opportunity. Simon sharing HBR research that "AI doesn't reduce work, it intensifies it." This maps directly to BuildOS's thesis: the problem isn't doing MORE with AI, it's having CLARITY about what to do. AI without context = more output of the wrong things = burnout. AI with context = less work, right output. 26 replies at 1h means still room to stand out with a specific angle. 145K follower account = massive visibility.

**Engagement Mode:** Value - The problem isn't output volume, it's clarity

**Replies:** _Pending Stage 2_

---

### 4. Dex (@dexhorthy) - Opus 4.6 = "Secretly Sonnet 5"

**Post Link:** https://x.com/dexhorthy (16h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> alright maybe @secemp9 was right about opus 4.6 being secretly sonnet 5 cause...what

(Shows git bisect screenshot where Claude correctly identified a bug with trailing newlines in migration files)

**Stats:** 3 replies, 0 RTs, 30 likes, 6.2K views

**Opportunity Type:** AI reality check / Community
**Why This Tweet:**
Dex impressed by Claude's debugging abilities. DJ uses Opus 4.6 daily - could share similar "wow" moment. Lower priority than the PR alignment post but good relationship maintenance. Engaging on both Dex posts signals genuine interest, not just topical surfing.

**Engagement Mode:** Cheerleader/Value - Share own Opus 4.6 debugging experience

**Replies:** _Pending Stage 2_

---

### 5. Noah Kagan (@noahkagan) - 72 Hours with OpenClaw

**Post Link:** https://x.com/noahkagan (23h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> 72 hours with OpenClaw - 100% overhyped and 100% amazing!
>
> Last week I joined AppSumo's OpenClaw workshop, set it up live and then got obsessed ever since...
>
> So much so I had it run my X account for the past few days.
>
> The hype is real but people are also completely full of it.

**Stats:** 43 replies, 13 RTs, 208 likes, 32K views

**Opportunity Type:** AI reality check
**Why This Tweet:**
Noah Kagan (AppSumo founder, huge audience) giving a balanced "both overhyped AND amazing" take on OpenClaw/AI agents. The "hype is real but people are full of it" angle maps perfectly to DJ's "excited pragmatism" tone. 43 replies is getting crowded but 32K views = massive visibility. Lowest priority because of age and reply count.

**Engagement Mode:** Value - The gap between hype and reality is context

**Replies:** _Pending Stage 2_

---

## Competitor Intelligence

### @bcherny (Boris Cherny) - Claude Code Creator

**Followers:** 247.7K (up from 246.7K yesterday, +1K)
**Activity:** No new posts since Feb 7. Fast mode thread still growing: 266K views (up from 239K), 140 replies, 1.7K likes. /rewind at 50K views.
**Implications:** Fast mode thread is 2 days old now with 140 replies - very crowded. No fresh engagement opportunity today.
**Action:** Skip Boris today - thread too old and crowded. Wait for next post.

### @dexhorthy (Dex) - Context Engineering Pioneer

**Followers:** 11.8K (stable)
**Bio Update:** Now includes "ai that works pod @ hlyr.dev/aitw" - NEW PODCAST NAME
**Activity:** PR alignment markdown doc post (1h, ULTRA FRESH), Opus 4.6 appreciation (16h), "friends ship" casual (19h)
**Key Intel:** Dex's podcast is called "AI That Works" at hlyr.dev/aitw. This is the Latent Space successor. He's building hlyr.dev/code (post-IDE IDE).
**Implications:** Dex is actively posting about context engineering in practice. The PR alignment post is exactly BuildOS's thesis applied to coding.
**Action:** ENGAGE on PR alignment post NOW - #1 opportunity today.

### @danshipper (Dan Shipper) - Every/Spiral - Compound Engineering

**Followers:** 91.8K (up from 91.4K yesterday, +400)
**Activity:** Reposted Kieran Klaassen (13m ago at scan): "Compound Engineering: The Definitive Guide" video walkthrough. @every (50m): "Most codebases get harder over time. Compound engineering makes them easier." Dan original (2h): Claude Opus 4.6 vibe coding Linux kernel meme - 5 replies, 40 likes, 7K views.
**Key Intel:** Compound Engineering getting a "Definitive Guide" video = framework is maturing. Dan actively promoting it.
**Implications:** CE vs Compound Engineering terminology battle continues. Dan's meme post (7K views) shows his reach. No direct engagement opportunity that maps to BuildOS today.
**Action:** Monitor. No direct engagement opportunity. Watch terminology battle.

### @simonw (Simon Willison) - AI Development Thought Leader

**Followers:** 145K (up from 144.9K yesterday)
**Activity:** FRESH - "AI Doesn't Reduce Work—It Intensifies It" HBR research (1h, 17K views, 26 replies). Follow-up with HBR link (49m). Feb 8: kakapo mug (personal).
**Key Intel:** HBR research validating that AI productivity boost leads to burnout. Simon noticed this in his own work.
**Implications:** The "AI intensifies work" narrative is emerging as a counterweight to AI hype. BuildOS's thesis (clarity > output) is the answer to this burnout problem.
**Action:** ENGAGE on AI burnout post - #3 opportunity today.

### @levelsio (Pieter Levels) - Indie Hacker Benchmark

**Followers:** 820.1K (up from 817.3K, +2.8K)

**Implications:** Levelsio posting mostly health/lifestyle/nomad content today. No AI or building-aligned engagement opportunity.
**Action:** Skip today. No engagement opportunity aligned with BuildOS.

### @dannypostma (Danny Postma) - PostmaOS - Still Quiet

**Followers:** 167.8K (unchanged from yesterday)
**Bio:** Still "Laying low"
**Activity:** Last post Feb 1. No new content.
**Implications:** Still on mental health break. 9th straight day of silence.
**Action:** Continue monitoring for return.

## Strategy Observations

- **Dex PR alignment post = #1 opportunity** - ULTRA FRESH, only 7 replies, perfect CLAUDE.md angle on the post from the person who coined "context engineering"
- **Aakash Gupta context engineering post = SURPRISE FIND** - ZERO replies on a 20m post from a major PM influencer who's literally describing what CLAUDE.md files do. New account to track. PM audience = BuildOS target users.
- **Simon Willison "AI intensifies work" = emerging narrative** - HBR research validating that AI burnout is real. BuildOS's answer: the problem isn't AI output volume, it's clarity about what to build. Context engineering prevents the "more output of wrong things" problem.
- **"Context engineering" search is yielding gold** - The term is spreading beyond just Dex. @aakashgupta using it for PM audience, @ZoltanErdos making videos about it. The terminology is winning.
- **Compound Engineering terminology battle escalating** - Dan Shipper now has a "Definitive Guide" video. But "context engineering" is spreading organically while "compound engineering" is being pushed by one org.
- **ADHD search remains thin** - No strong new ADHD+AI posts today. The niche is underserved but Sunday mornings are quiet for it.
- **Claude Code still trending in news** - "Developer's Retro Sounds Hack Revives Claude Code Sessions" and "OpenAI Codex 5.3" benchmark comparison. Claude Code ecosystem remains hot.
- **Sunday morning = low competition** - Good timing for first-reply opportunities on Dex and Aakash posts.
- **DJ still hasn't posted since Dec 12, 2025** - Engagement replies are building relationships but original content needed soon.
