## Tweet Opportunities

### 1. Tyler Sookochoff - Notion AI Context Fragmentation

**Post Link:** https://x.com/tylersookochoff/status/2020571979921637856

**The Tweet:**

> Notion AI would great if you literally didnt use any other apps. None. Ever. But the second you do, context becomes fragmented. The goal for anyone using cloud services now should be BYOA.

**Stats:** 0 replies, 0 reposts, 0 likes, 7 views (45m)
**Opportunity Type:** Tool Frustration / AI Reality Check

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
This is a perfect @build_os angle. The "context becomes fragmented" insight is exactly the problem BuildOS addresses - your AI should know your full context, not just what's in one app. The BYOA (Bring Your Own Agent?) framing is interesting. Very fresh post, zero replies = maximum visibility for @build_os reply.

**Product mention appropriate?** Yes - with caveat. Context fragmentation is our core thesis.

**Replies:**

**Option A (Recommended - validate + soft product mention with caveat):**

> this is the whole problem. your AI is only as good as the context it can see. and if your life is spread across 6 apps... it sees 1/6th of you.
>
> been building around this exact problem at @build_os - trying to make context work across the mess, not just inside one walled garden. still figuring it out honestly but the BYOA framing is right.

_Why this works: Validates the insight, adds a layer ("1/6th of you"), mentions BuildOS naturally with an honest caveat ("still figuring it out"). Engages with their BYOA framing which shows we actually read the tweet._

**Option B (Pure validation, no product - community building):**

> this is underrated. everyone's hyped about AI features inside individual apps. nobody's talking about the fact that your context is shattered across 12 different tools and none of them talk to each other.
>
> the app that wins isn't the smartest AI. it's the one that can actually see your full picture.

_Why this works: Amplifies their point without making it about us. Establishes @build_os as someone with a clear perspective on the space. Could stand alone even if BuildOS didn't exist - passes the quality check._

**Option C (Edgier, more direct):**

> notion AI knowing your Notion stuff is like a doctor who only reads one page of your chart.
>
> fragmented context = fragmented AI. the BYOA thing is exactly right.

_Why this works: Punchy analogy that's memorable and retweetable. Shortest of the three - sometimes less is more on a fresh, low-engagement tweet. Gets in early without overstaying._

### 2. Backseats - "AI Theatre" Reality Check

**Post Link:** https://x.com/backseats_eth/status/2020546114408108480

**The Tweet:**

> +1 to a lot of this
>
> So much AI theatre going on right now
>
> Read @every, follow @danshipper and @kieranklaassen
>
> Watch lots of YouTube videos, ignore a lot of it but there are some nuggets
>
> Read lots of skills, don't install them all. Bookmark, star, then forget
>
> My best improvements come from process articles, trying it to make something real
>
> Spend more time on content of experienced engineers updating their processes with AI than vibe coders who learned last month

**Stats:** 1 reply, 4 reposts, 11 likes, 16 bookmarks, 3,308 views (2h)
**Opportunity Type:** AI Reality Check

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
This is the "excited pragmatism" sweet spot from the reply strategy. They're calling out AI hype while still engaging with it. References @danshipper and @every (Dan Shipper's company). The "experienced engineers updating processes > vibe coders who learned last month" take is 100% aligned with @build_os voice. Good engagement (11 likes, 16 bookmarks) means this is resonating.

**Product mention appropriate?** No - community only. Agree and amplify the honest take.

**Replies:**

**Option A (Recommended - agree and amplify with specific insight):**

> "experienced engineers updating their processes with AI > vibe coders who learned last month" is the tweet of the year honestly.
>
> the signal-to-noise ratio in AI content is brutal right now. everyone has a take. almost nobody has shipped something real with it. the process articles are where the actual gold is.

_Why this works: Directly amplifies the strongest line in their tweet. Adds genuine perspective without hijacking. No product mention. The "shipped something real" angle subtly positions @build_os as a builder without naming it._

**Option B (Shorter, punchier agreement):**

> "bookmark, star, then forget" is the most accurate description of how everyone is actually using AI right now.
>
> the gap between "this is cool" and "this actually changed my workflow" is enormous. process over hype, every time.

_Why this works: Picks a different line to amplify, keeping it fresh. The "gap" insight adds to the conversation. Conversational and light._

**Option C (More personal/builder angle):**

> damn this is accurate. been building with AI daily for 9 months and the things that actually moved the needle weren't the flashy agent demos. it was small boring process changes that compounded.
>
> the AI theatre is loud. the real work is quiet.

_Why this works: Shares genuine building experience without naming BuildOS. "9 months" signals credibility. The closing line is memorable and quotable. Holds the excited-pragmatism tension well._

### 3. Alex Sofroniev - Notion Agents = "No-Code Theater"

**Post Link:** https://x.com/DevOffScript/status/2020567887820238979

**The Tweet:**

> Notion agents executing custom scripts sounds nice until you realize most users will just prompt-engineer the same landing page builder they already have.
>
> The real question: can this actually replace a developer or is it just another "no-code" theater for people afraid to learn?

**Stats:** 0 replies, 0 likes, 34 views (1h)
**Opportunity Type:** Tool Frustration / AI Reality Check

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
Skeptical take on today's big Notion Agents 2.0 news. The "no-code theater" framing is provocative and aligns with @build_os's anti-complexity stance. @build_os can add the perspective that the real problem isn't whether agents can replace devs - it's whether they can actually help normal people get organized without needing to become a programmer.

**Product mention appropriate?** No - engage on the "theater" angle, not product.

**Replies:**

**Option A (Recommended - reframe the real question):**

> "no-code theater" is a great way to put it. but I think the question isn't "can this replace a developer" - it's can this help a normal person get organized without needing to become a developer first.
>
> and right now the answer is... not really. more configuration layers just means more ways to set it up wrong.

_Why this works: Engages directly with their "no-code theater" framing, then adds a different angle they didn't consider (normal people, not devs). The last line is a specific, honest take that adds to the conversation without being preachy._

**Option B (Shorter, more provocative agreement):**

> the "no-code theater" thing is real. every new AI feature announcement is the same pitch: "now you can automate anything!" cool. now explain it to someone who just wants to remember what they were working on yesterday.
>
> complexity dressed up as simplicity.

_Why this works: Punchy. "Complexity dressed up as simplicity" is quotable. Validates their skepticism while adding the @build_os worldview (tools should serve scattered minds, not power users) without naming the product._

**Option C (Agree but with nuance - more measured):**

> fair question. I think it's neither replacing devs nor theater exactly - it's automation for people who already know what they want automated.
>
> which leaves out... most people. the ones who need help figuring out WHAT to do, not just automating how they do it.

_Why this works: Adds genuine nuance rather than just pile-on agreement. The "what to do vs how to do it" distinction is the @build_os thesis without mentioning the product. Shows independent thinking._

### 4. Boris Cherny - Claude Code Fast Mode Launch

**Post Link:** https://x.com/bcherny/status/2020223254297031110

**The Tweet:**

> We just launched an experimental new fast mode for Opus 4.6.
>
> The team has been building with it for the last few weeks. It's been a huge unlock for me personally, especially when going back and forth with Claude on a tricky problem.

**Stats:** 129 replies, 96 reposts, 1,661 likes, 290 bookmarks, 239,680 views (23h)
**Opportunity Type:** AI Tool News / Community

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
Boris is the Claude Code creator (245K followers). This is massive AI tooling news. @build_os uses Claude in its stack. However, 129 replies means this is very crowded. Better suited as a like/bookmark than a reply unless we have a genuinely unique angle. Could work if @build_os comments on the "going back and forth on a tricky problem" part - that's the context/iteration loop that matters.

**Product mention appropriate?** Maybe - only if the angle is genuinely about building with AI tools, with honest caveat about what's hard.

**Replies:**

**Option A (Recommended - builder perspective on the "back and forth" part):**

> the "going back and forth on a tricky problem" part is what matters most here. speed is great but the real unlock with claude has always been the iteration loop - keeping context while you think through something together.
>
> faster iterations on that loop is genuinely exciting. been building with claude code daily and the conversation quality matters more than the speed.

_Why this works: Engages with a specific detail most people are ignoring (everyone else is just saying "congrats" or "amazing"). The "conversation quality > speed" take is contrarian enough to stand out in 129 replies. No product mention needed - it's a pure builder take._

**Option B (Honest builder take with soft product mention):**

> been using claude code to build every day for months. some days it genuinely 10x's me. some days I spend an hour fixing what it confidently broke.
>
> faster mode on the good days? hell yes. curious if it also makes the bad days faster too lol. excited to try it.

_Why this works: Honest about the real experience of building with AI (good AND bad). Humor at the end keeps it light. Shows @build_os as a genuine Claude user, not just engagement farming. Self-deprecating in a way that builds trust._

**Option C (Shorter, higher chance of standing out in crowded replies):**

> the back-and-forth iteration is where the magic actually happens. speed on that loop > speed on first-pass generation every time. excited to try this.

_Why this works: Shortest option - sometimes in a thread with 129 replies, brevity wins. Makes one specific, slightly contrarian point (iteration speed > generation speed) that could spark agreement. Clean and memorable._

### 5. girlfromipanema - ADHD Productivity Pain

**Post Link:** https://x.com/girlfromip/status/2020565614604001703

**The Tweet:**

> ADHD affects productivity so so bad

**Stats:** 0 replies, 0 reposts, 3 likes, 51 views (1h)
**Opportunity Type:** ADHD Validation

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
Simple, raw, relatable. This is the kind of post where @build_os shows up as a supportive presence, not a salesperson. No product mention - just validation. The simplicity of the statement ("so so bad") resonates because it's not dressed up in productivity-speak.

**Product mention appropriate?** No - pure validation only.

**Replies:**

**Option A (Recommended - validation with relatable specificity):**

> and then people hit you with the "just make a list and prioritize" like your brain isn't already running 47 tabs with no idea which one is playing music

_Why this works: Pure validation with humor. Adds specificity to their general statement - the "47 tabs" metaphor is instantly relatable to ADHD brains. Zero product mention. The kind of reply that makes someone feel genuinely seen and want to follow you._

**Option B (Simpler, warmer validation):**

> so so bad is honestly the perfect way to describe it. not dramatically bad. just constantly, quietly, relentlessly bad. every single day.

_Why this works: Mirrors their exact language ("so so bad") which shows we actually read and felt the tweet. Adds emotional specificity without being preachy or trying to fix anything. Pure "I see you" energy._

**Option C (Validation + reframe, slightly edgier):**

> the worst part is how invisible it is. you're not "unproductive" - you're doing 10x the mental work just to do the same task. people don't see that part.

_Why this works: Validates while reframing - it's not about being unproductive, it's about the invisible overhead. Slightly more substantive than pure agreement. Defends ADHD brains without being preachy about it._

### 6. Simone Fortier - Fight-or-Flight vs Productivity

**Post Link:** https://x.com/simonefortier/status/2020542273306681738

**The Tweet:**

> A brain stuck in fight-or-flight will:
>
> - Avoid decisions
> - Sabotage consistency
> - Chase urgency over clarity
> - Confuse stress with productivity
>   No mindset hack fixes that.
>   Eating real food and getting the right support does.

**Stats:** Low engagement (2h)
**Opportunity Type:** ADHD / Productivity Reframe

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
The "confuse stress with productivity" line is powerful. This reframes why productivity tools fail - it's not the tool, it's the nervous system state. @build_os angle: tools designed for fight-or-flight brains need to be radically simple, not add more decisions. Good community building opportunity.

**Product mention appropriate?** No - community only.

**Replies:**

**Option A (Recommended - amplify the strongest line):**

> "confuse stress with productivity" is the one. that feeling of being busy and wired and going going going... and then realizing you didn't actually move anything forward. just burned energy on urgency.
>
> the no-mindset-hack part is real too. you can't hustle your way out of a nervous system problem.

_Why this works: Picks out the most powerful line and expands on it with relatable specificity. The "burned energy on urgency" adds to the conversation. Agrees with the "no hack" thesis which is anti-productivity-guru positioning. Zero product mention._

**Option B (Shorter, focused agreement):**

> "chase urgency over clarity" is the whole thing. most productivity systems are literally designed around urgency - due dates, reminders, red notifications. no wonder it doesn't work for a brain that's already in overdrive.

_Why this works: Takes one bullet point and connects it to a broader insight about why productivity tools fail. The "tools designed around urgency" angle is the @build_os worldview without ever mentioning the product. Concise and specific._

**Option C (Personal, more vulnerable):**

> the avoid-decisions one hits hard. decision fatigue when your brain is already in survival mode is brutal. you're not lazy, you're overwhelmed.
>
> people keep trying to solve this with apps and systems. sometimes the answer is literally just eating lunch and going outside. wild concept.

_Why this works: Picks the "avoid decisions" bullet which is deeply relatable. "You're not lazy, you're overwhelmed" is validating. The ending echoes their point about food/support with humor. Shows @build_os as self-aware enough to say sometimes the answer isn't an app._

## Competitive Intel

### Notion Agents 2.0 - Major Launch Today

Notion is building Agents 2.0 with:

- **Workers** - dedicated automation layers connecting external tools (GitHub, Slack)
- **Native script execution** - custom scripts that agents can operate

**@build_os Angle:** This is Notion doubling down on complexity. More automation layers, more scripts, more configuration. For power users, this is great. For scattered minds? It's another layer of "set it up perfectly or it won't work." The @tylersookochoff reply nails it: Notion AI only works if you don't use any other apps.

**Recommended:** Post an original @build_os take on Notion Agents 2.0 if time permits. Something like: "notion just announced agents 2.0 with custom scripts and automation workers. cool for power users. but if setting up the automation is harder than doing the task... what's the point?"

## Cross-Promotion Opportunity

**@djwayne3 Post Worth Engaging:** None this scan - @djwayne3 last posted Dec 12, 2025.

**Recommended:** DJ should post something about Claude Code fast mode or the Notion Agents 2.0 news. Either topic would give @build_os a natural cross-promo opportunity.

## Strategy Observations

### Today's Big Stories

1. **Notion Agents 2.0 launch** - Dominating the "Notion" search space. Perfect @build_os counter-narrative opportunity: more automation layers = more complexity for regular users.

2. **Claude Code fast mode (Opus 4.6)** - @bcherny and @alexalbert\_\_ both posted about it. Massive engagement. More of a @djwayne3 topic (builder/practitioner) than @build_os, but could angle toward "AI tools getting faster doesn't help if they forget your context between sessions."

3. **"AI theatre" backlash growing** - @backseats_eth's post about AI theatre (3.3K views, 16 bookmarks) shows the pragmatic builder crowd is tired of hype. This is @build_os's sweet spot.

### Observations

- **It's Sunday** - Lower overall tweet volume, especially from indie hackers and ADHD content creators. Weekday scans tend to yield more results.
- **Notion conversation today is about features, not frustration** - The Agents 2.0 news shifted the Notion conversation from "I hate Notion" to "look what Notion is building." @build_os can counter with "more features isn't the answer."
- **ADHD content sparse today** - Only casual mentions, no deep productivity-focused ADHD posts with engagement.
- **@djwayne3 still completely inactive** - Going on 2 months since last post. This limits @build_os cross-promo significantly.

### Recommendations

1. **Prioritize the Notion AI angle** - @tylersookochoff and @DevOffScript posts are fresh, low competition, and perfectly aligned
2. **Engage @backseats_eth on AI theatre** - This is the anti-marketing sweet spot
3. **Consider an original @build_os post** about Notion Agents 2.0 - hot topic, contrarian take available
4. **Save @bcherny for @djwayne3** - Builder/practitioner angle fits DJ better

### Recommended Order & Timing

Post replies in this order, spaced 15-25 minutes apart to avoid looking like a bot doing a reply blitz.

| Order          | Tweet                                                  | Recommended Option                                        | Timing  | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1st            | **#1 @tylersookochoff** (Notion context fragmentation) | **Option A** (validate + soft product mention)            | ASAP    | Freshest tweet (45m), zero replies = first-mover advantage. This is the highest-value opportunity today. Product mention is warranted here.                                                                             |
| 2nd            | **#3 @DevOffScript** (Notion "no-code theater")        | **Option A** (reframe the real question)                  | +15 min | Also fresh (1h), zero replies. Pairs well with #1 as a Notion Agents counter-narrative double-tap. No product mention keeps the 80/20 ratio clean.                                                                      |

The "9 months building" detail adds credibility. This one has the best chance of getting likes/reposts from the pragmatic builder crowd.                                          |
| 4th            | **#5 @girlfromip** (ADHD productivity)                 | **Option A** (47 tabs humor)                              | +20 min | ADHD validation with humor. Palette cleanser between the AI/Notion replies. Low engagement tweet = our reply might be the most engagement they get, building genuine connection.                                        |
| 5th            | **#6 @simonefortier** (fight-or-flight)                | **Option A** (amplify "confuse stress with productivity") | +15 min | Pairs naturally after the ADHD reply. The self-aware "sometimes the answer isn't an app" energy (if using Option C) is good positioning.                                                                                |
| 6th (optional) | **#4 @bcherny** (Claude Code fast mode)                | **Option C** (short, contrarian)                          | +25 min | Most crowded thread (129 replies). Use the shortest option to stand out. Consider skipping if time is tight - this is the lowest ROI given competition. Alternatively, save for @djwayne3 if DJ is going to post today. |

### Today's Product Mention Budget

- **1 product mention total** (Tweet #1 @tylersookochoff - Option A)
- **5 community-only replies** (Tweets #2, #3, #4, #5, #6)
- **Ratio: 83% no product mention / 17% soft mention** - within the 80/20 guideline

### Additional Recommendations

1. **Like & bookmark** @backseats_eth's tweet and @bcherny's tweet even if you don't reply to #4
2. **Consider the original Notion Agents 2.0 post** suggested in Competitive Intel section - today's hot topic provides a natural content opportunity
3. **If DJ posts today** about Claude Code fast mode or Notion Agents, @build_os should engage with that tweet for cross-promo

### Quality Check Summary

All replies were verified against the anti-marketing playbook checklist:

- Would I say this if BuildOS didn't exist? YES (all replies except #1 Option A stand alone)
- Am I adding to this conversation or hijacking it? ADDING (each reply extends the original thought)
- Is this honest? YES (includes caveats on #1, no overselling anywhere)
- Does this hold the tension? YES (excited AND pragmatic throughout)
- Would this person want to follow me after reading this? YES (each reply shows genuine engagement)
