## 1. Dex Horthy - "Do Not Outsource the Thinking" (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Post Link:** https://x.com/dexhorthy/status/2010486586803126499

**The Tweet:**
> do not outsource the thinking

(Quote tweeting @mitchellh: "The people who just blindly toss AI sh*t over a wall onto other humans without using their brain for even a nanosecond deserve shaming...")

**Stats:** 53 likes, 1 RT, 7.3K views | Follower count: 10.7K (up from 3.2K!)

**Why This Tweet:**
@dexhorthy COINED "context engineering" - this is THE strategic account. His 16h post perfectly aligns with DJ's "blue collar software engineering" philosophy. Mitchell Hashimoto (HashiCorp co-founder) is calling out low-effort AI output. Dex's distillation is sharp and memorable.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Builder solidarity - Recommended):**
> this is the whole game right now. the token burn flex means nothing if you're not thinking about what comes out the other end.
>
> been using claude code daily - the sessions that actually ship value aren't about how many tokens i spent. they're about having the right context loaded first and actually reviewing what comes back.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Direct + punchy):**
> the ai output is only as good as the thinking you put in before and after.
>
> outsourcing the thinking is just expensive copy-paste with extra steps.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Short agreement):**
> the people shipping real value are the ones reviewing every line, not the ones bragging about automation.

## 2. Dan Shipper - "Proof" Product Launch (COMPETITOR INTEL)

**Post Link:** https://x.com/danshipper/status/2009651408144835021

**The Tweet:**
> Proof is a new agent-native markdown editor I've been quietly building for the last 6 months. It's redesigned from the ground up to give AI first class access to the underlying document...

**Stats:** High engagement (pinned, 340K+ views on architecture guide)

**Why This Tweet:**
MAJOR competitor activity. Dan launched "Proof" - an "agent-native" markdown editor. His pinned "Agent-Native Architecture" guide has 340K views. Key concept: "agent-native" = giving AI first-class access to documents. This is direct competition to BuildOS's context approach.

**Action:** Monitor closely. Don't engage directly on product launch - study his positioning.

**Key Concepts to Track:**
- "Agent-native architecture" - documents designed for AI access
- Multi-file context handling
- "Ground truth" documents

**Suggested Reply (Cheerleader mode if engaging):**
> been watching the every space evolve. curious how you're thinking about context persistence across sessions - seems like the next frontier after document access.

## 3. DropzoneAI - Context Engineering Reliability (FRESH)

**Post Link:** https://x.com/DropzoneAI/status/2010722023849222275

**The Tweet:**
> Prompt engineering, context engineering, scaffolding ... these are all terms that engineers grappling with this new technology are using to describe the techniques required to get agentic systems to behave reliably.

**Stats:** Fresh post, opportunity to be early

**Why This Tweet:**
Fresh discussion of "context engineering" as a term gaining traction. Connects it to reliability - a key angle for BuildOS (context = reliability).

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Validate + extend - Recommended):**
> the term evolution is interesting to watch. prompt engineering felt like the "tricks" phase. context engineering feels like the "systems" phase.
>
> reliability comes from the context you've prepared, not the prompt you've crafted.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Experience-based):**
> seeing this firsthand with claude code. the prompts are almost secondary now - it's all about what context files you've got loaded.

## 4. Acontext.io - Context Data Platform (NEW COMPETITOR)

**Post Link:** https://x.com/acontext_io/status/2010720420954055020

**The Tweet:**
> This is why context engineering needs a dedicated context data platform. When context is fragmented across tools, agents cannot observe or learn reliably. Acontext provides a unified context data layer...

**Product:** ACONTEXT - "context data platform for building cloud-native AI Agents"
- Store contexts & artifacts
- Do context engineering for you
- Observe agent tasks and user feedback
- Enable agent self-learning

**Why This Tweet:**
NEW competitor in the "context engineering" space. They're building infrastructure-level context management. Track their positioning and growth.

**Action:** Follow @acontext_io, monitor their messaging. Don't engage yet - study first.

## 5. Mitchell Hashimoto - AI Output Quality (ORIGINAL SOURCE)

**Post Link:** https://x.com/mitchellh/status/2010457189350047769

**The Tweet:**
> The people who just blindly toss AI sh*t over a wall onto other humans without using their brain for even a nanosecond deserve shaming. We need to start a public wall of shame for the public identities (not doxing) of these people so we can have bots that just block them.

**Stats:** High engagement from HashiCorp co-founder

**Why This Tweet:**
This is the original post @dexhorthy quote-tweeted. Mitchell has massive credibility (HashiCorp founder). His frustration with low-effort AI output validates the "thinking still required" thesis.

**Suggested Reply (if engaging here too):**
> the quality bar for ai-assisted work is actually higher now, not lower. people think they can skip the thinking part and it shows immediately.

## Posting Strategy

**Recommended Order:**
1. **@dexhorthy "do not outsource thinking"** - POST FIRST (he's context engineering originator)
2. **@DropzoneAI context engineering** - Within 30 min (very fresh, be early)
3. **@mitchellh original** - Optional follow-up for visibility

**Timing Notes:**
- Space replies 30+ min apart
- @DropzoneAI post is only ~1h old - early engagement matters
- Don't mention BuildOS in every reply - max 1 natural mention
- Dan Shipper: Study, don't engage yet on product launch

## Voice Reminder

### The Philosophy
**Interesting guy + cheerleader. NOT a thought leader.**

### Two Modes
1. **Value Mode:** When you have experience to share
   - Specific details from using Claude Code daily
   - Context engineering observations
   - Solo founder journey

2. **Cheerleader Mode:** When you don't
   - Genuine curiosity and questions
   - "hell yes" energy for wins
   - Celebrate their insights specifically

### The 3 Rules (for Value Mode)
1. **Can I visualize it?** - Specific details, not abstractions
2. **Can I falsify it?** - Real experience you could defend
3. **Can nobody else say this?** - Use Marines (sparingly), solo founder, Claude Code daily user

### Quick Don'ts
- No "love this" or "great post" (hollow)
- No "this resonated" (generic)
- No preachy teaching when supporting
- Don't make it about you when cheering

## Strategic Notes

### Context Engineering Landscape Update

1. **@dexhorthy follower explosion** - 3.2K → 10.7K in weeks. Context engineering is mainstream now.
2. **New player: Acontext.io** - Building "context data platform" - infrastructure play
3. **Dan Shipper's "agent-native"** - Competing terminology to watch

### Recommended Strategy Updates

1. **Accelerate context engineering engagement** - The term is gaining traction fast
2. **Monitor Acontext.io** - They're building similar infrastructure thesis
3. **Study Dan Shipper's "Proof"** - Agent-native architecture is their angle
4. **ADHD accounts quiet** - Opportunity to be more active in that space
