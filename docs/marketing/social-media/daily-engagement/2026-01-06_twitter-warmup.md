## 1. Brandon Waselnuk (reposted by Dan Shipper) - Context Engineering

**Post Link:** https://x.com/BrandonWa/status/2008655657327841400

**The Tweet:**

> how people use your product != how they want to use it
>
> a compelling take from @danshipper here on how architecture can be shaped to allow for emergent capabilities and discovering latent demand from customers
>
> context engineering will be critical for this style of app

**Stats:** 0 replies, 1 RT, 3 likes (12m ago - EXTREMELY FRESH)

**Why This Tweet:**
This is a GOLDMINE. Brandon explicitly uses the phrase "context engineering" - YOUR exact terminology. Dan reposted it giving it visibility. Zero replies means you can be first and own this thread.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Direct agreement + expand):**

> context engineering is the unlock nobody's talking about.
>
> the agent isn't the moat. the context you feed it is.
>
> been obsessively capturing project context in markdown files - brand strategy, SOPs, past decisions. same agent + better context = completely different output.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Question + insight):**

> "context engineering will be critical" - this is the part most people skip.
>
> they optimize the prompt. they swap models. they add tools.
>
> but the real leverage is in what context you've captured BEFORE the conversation starts. what's your stack for that?

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Shortest, punchy):**

> context engineering > prompt engineering.
>
> the model is the commodity. your context is the moat.

## 2. Dan Shipper - Agent-Native Apps

**Post Link:** https://x.com/danshipper/status/2008570241756852584

**The Tweet:**

> we're only building agent-native apps @every now
>
> here's what that means:
>
> **traditional software architecture:** you write code that defines what happens. The computer executes your instructions.
>
> **agent-native architecture:** you define outcomes in natural language. the agent figures out how to achieve them using tools. in an agent-native world, **features are prompts** not code.
>
> good agent-native architectures have the following characteristics:
>
> - **parity.** anything the user can do in the app, the agent can do.
> - **granularity.** features are prompts, not tools. the agent has access to tools that are more atomic than features so a few tool calls are composed into a single feature.
> - **composability.** this enables composability: the agent can combine tool calls in new ways easily.
>
> all of the above enables **emergent capability** in your app—it can do things you didn't plan for. this allows you to discover **latent demand** from your users that inform your roadmap. this a core way that @bcherny builds features in Claude Code—which is architected with all of the above characteristics

**Stats:** 35 replies, 31 RTs, 404 likes, 40.2K views (6h ago)

**Why This Tweet:**
Dan is laying out the exact architecture pattern you're building toward. He mentions Claude Code and emergent capabilities. This is your space - you can add the "what makes agents actually useful" angle (context).

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Add the missing piece):**

> the piece that makes all of this work: persistent context.
>
> agent-native architecture is powerful but agents still start every session with amnesia. the missing layer is captured context - project history, past decisions, user preferences.
>
> intelligence is cheap now. memory is the unlock.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Agree + extend with experience):**

> been building with claude code daily. the "emergent capability" thing is real - but only when you feed it enough context.
>
> same agent + my project markdown files (brand strategy, SOPs, past decisions) = genuinely useful.
>
> same agent with no context = impressive autocomplete.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Shorter, direct):**

> features are prompts. but prompts without context are just wishes.
>
> the emergent capability only emerges when the agent knows your project, your constraints, your history.

## 3. Shaan Puri - Choose The Right People To Impress

**Post Link:** https://x.com/ShaanVP/status/2008609847164400000

**The Tweet:**

> It's ok to want to impress other people, but choose the right people

**Stats:** 33 replies, 2 RTs, 144 likes (4h ago)

**Why This Tweet:**
Classic Shaan wisdom post. You can tie this to the solo founder journey and who you're building for.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Direct question + context):**

> real question: who should i be trying to impress with build-os?
>
> building for scattered ADHD minds who abandoned Notion 6 times. feels like the right audience but always second-guessing.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Insight from experience):**

> took me too long to learn this.
>
> spent years trying to impress people who would never use what i build. now i only care about the scattered minds who can't stick with complex tools.
>
> smaller audience. actually gives a shit.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Marines angle):**

> in the marines we'd say "know your audience."
>
> the general doesn't care about the same things as your squad. building for the wrong crowd is just running in the wrong direction faster.

## 4. Lenny Rachitsky - Coding Agents Need Product Agents

**Post Link:** https://x.com/lennysan/status/2008625000000000000

**The Tweet:**

> First they came for CX, and I said nothing...
>
> (Quote of Jordan Singer's article: "Coding agents need product agents")
>
> "Coding is getting cheap. Decision-making is still expensive. Coding agents have collapsed the cost of implementation. Shipping is accelerating..."

**Stats:** 9 replies, 3 RTs, 52 likes, 8.1K views (3h ago)

**Why This Tweet:**
Perfect setup for the "decision-making requires context" angle. Already replied to this earlier - can skip or add a follow-up.

**ALREADY REPLIED - SKIP OR FOLLOW UP**

## 5. Lenny Rachitsky - Best of Newsletter 2026

**Post Link:** https://x.com/lennysan/status/2008600000000000000

**The Tweet:**

> Best of Lenny's Newsletter 2026
>
> My 25 best and most popular essays from the past year, plus a few all-time classics

**Stats:** 6 replies, 7 RTs, 73 likes, 13K views (5h ago)

**Why This Tweet:**
Low reply count for a big account. Good opportunity for a thoughtful question that could get engagement.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Curious question):**

> always curious about the gap between "what you thought would hit" vs "what actually hit."
>
> which piece surprised you most - either way?

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Specific callback):**

> the "give away your legos" piece still lives rent-free in my head.
>
> curious if your thinking on that has evolved at all - especially with AI changing what "letting go" looks like for product leaders.

## Posting Strategy

**Recommended Order:**

1. **Brandon Waselnuk repost** - POST FIRST (12m ago, 0 replies - be first!)
2. **Dan Shipper agent-native** - within 30 min (high relevance)
3. **Shaan's "impress" post** - space 30+ min apart
4. **Lenny's Best Of** - low priority, can do later

**Timing:** Post the Brandon/Dan replies NOW while fresh. Space remaining replies 30+ min apart.

**Note:** You already replied to Lenny's "coding agents" post earlier today. Skip that one.

## Voice Reminder

### The 3 Rules

1. Can I visualize it?
2. Can I falsify it?
3. Can nobody else say this?

### Quick Don'ts

- No "love this" or "great post"
- No preachy setups
- No generic observations anyone could make
