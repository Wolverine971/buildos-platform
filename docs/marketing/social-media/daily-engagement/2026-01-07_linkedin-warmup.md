## Top Engagement Opportunities

### 1. Adnan Akram - "The Great AI Divide" ⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY

**Author:** Adnan Akram (Co-Founder & CEO at AlphaRages)
**Posted:** Just now
**Comments:** 0
**URL:** Found via "context engineering AI" search

**Post Summary:**
"The Great AI Divide: A Tale of Two Perspectives" - contrasts how Product Leaders vs Engineers view AI in development. Key insight: "CEO's role is to be the contextual compass" - framing context as essential to AI effectiveness.

**Why Engage:**

- Zero comments = first mover advantage
- "Contextual compass" directly aligns with BuildOS positioning
- Perfect for "context > agents" angle
- Fresh post = algorithm boost for early comments

**Comment Options:**

**Option A (Context Engineering Angle):**

```
"CEO as the contextual compass" - this is the frame most people miss.

I keep coming back to this building BuildOS: the AI isn't the bottleneck anymore. Context is. Engineers want to ship autonomous agents, but those agents start every session from zero.

The teams I've seen get this right aren't the ones with the smartest models. They're the ones investing in the scaffolding around the AI.

How are you seeing teams actually bridge this gap? The perspectives are clear - the handoff is where it falls apart.
```

**Option B (Curri Background):**

```
This resonates. At Curri I was connecting Uber, Lyft, DoorDash APIs before "AI tool use" was even a phrase. The insight then is the insight now: selecting the right tool for the context matters more than having every tool available.

The "contextual compass" frame is good. Who owns that layer though? Product people get it intuitively but engineers are the ones building the systems.

Curious how you're seeing that ownership shake out in practice.
```

**Option C (Direct/Shorter):**

```
This divide is real. Spent years watching engineers optimize for capability while product people optimized for usability — and the gap only gets wider with AI.

The teams I'm seeing win are the ones treating context as infrastructure, not an afterthought. "Contextual compass" is a great frame for what that looks like in practice.
```

### 2. Mike Steadman - Building in Public vs Stealth Mode ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY

**Author:** "IRON" Mike Steadman (Category Designer & Venture Partner)
**Posted:** 37 minutes ago
**Reactions:** 3
**Comments:** 3
**Tags:** #VeteranEntrepreneurs

**Post Summary:**
"A lot of founders hide behind 'stealth mode,' but you don't need to share your product in order to gain traction, just your problem. Most first-time founders, especially vets, are scared to share."

**Why Engage:**

- Very low competition (3 comments)
- #VeteranEntrepreneurs tag = perfect for DJ's Marine background
- Building in public is core content pillar
- Category designer = interesting potential connection

**Comment Options:**

**Option A (Veteran + Builder Angle):**

```
This hits different as a vet founder.

The Marines actually trained me to surface problems early - you're not asking for help, you're inviting collaboration. But translating that to "building in public"? That took unlearning.

What helped: separating the problem from the product. Talk about the problem constantly. Talk about the solution... selectively. Traction without vulnerability.

The "scared to share" thing is real though. We're wired for operational security, not public iteration. Curious what you've seen work to shift that mindset?
```

**Option B (Shorter):**

```
"Share your problem, not your product" - this is it.

Stealth mode on the solution. Loud on the problem.

As a vet founder, the hesitation is real. We're trained for opsec, not public vulnerability. Building in public meant rewiring that entire instinct.
```

**Option C (Direct):**

```
The problem vs product distinction is the whole thing.

Nobody cares about your solution until they feel the problem. I talk about context engineering and AI memory constantly now. The product is almost secondary.

Vet founders especially need to hear this - we're trained to execute quietly, not market loudly.
```

### 3. Falak Soomro - ChatGPT Connectors Review

**Author:** Falak Soomro
**Posted:** Fresh (within hours)
**Topic:** Review of ChatGPT's new Connectors feature

**Post Summary:**
Reviewing ChatGPT's Connectors feature for integrating with external tools and data sources.

**Why Engage:**

- Relevant to AI productivity/workflow space
- Lower competition than Tier 1 accounts
- Opportunity to share perspective on AI tool integration

**Comment Options:**

**Option A (Experience-Based):**

```
Connectors are the easy part. The hard question: who owns the context layer?

At Curri I built integrations connecting delivery APIs. The problem was never the plumbing - it was knowing which tool to use when, and carrying context between them.

Have you seen anything about how ChatGPT handles context persistence across connector calls? That's where most setups fall apart.
```

**Option B (Shorter):**

```
Connectors are interesting but I'm more curious about the context layer underneath.

Does it remember which connectors you've used and why? That's where most AI tool setups fall apart in practice.
```

### 4. Lenny Rachitsky - Best of Newsletter 2026 (Optional)

**Author:** Lenny Rachitsky
**Posted:** 22 hours ago
**Comments:** 58
**Type:** Newsletter retrospective

**Why Borderline:**

- 58 comments = harder to stand out
- 22 hours old = past prime algorithm window
- Tier 1 account = worth engaging if you have something substantial

**Comment Option (Only if time allows):**

```
What I appreciate about your approach: you treat product decisions as learnable patterns, not tribal knowledge.

Building as a solo founder, I keep coming back to your frameworks when I'm stuck on prioritization. Most productivity tools are built for managers. The ones that work for makers have to be opinionated about what NOT to do.
```
