## Top Engagement Opportunities

### 1. Adnan Akram - "The Great AI Divide" ⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY

**Author:** Adnan Akram (Co-Founder & CEO at AlphaRages)
**Posted:** Just now
**Comments:** 0
**URL:** Found via "context engineering AI" search

**Post Summary:**
"The Great AI Divide: A Tale of Two Perspectives" - contrasts how Product Leaders vs Engineers view AI in development. Key insight: "CEO's role is to be the contextual compass" - framing context as essential to AI effectiveness.

**Why Engage:**
- Zero comments = first mover advantage
- "Contextual compass" directly aligns with BuildOS positioning
- Perfect for "context > agents" angle
- Fresh post = algorithm boost for early comments

**Comment Options:**

**Option A (Context Engineering Angle):**
```
"CEO's role is to be the contextual compass" — this is the insight most AI conversations miss.

What I keep coming back to building BuildOS: the AI isn't the bottleneck anymore. Context is. Engineers want to ship autonomous agents, but those agents start every session from zero. Product leaders intuitively get that the value compounds when you invest in the scaffolding around the AI, not just the AI itself.

The divide you're describing isn't just about perspectives — it's about where the real leverage is. Curious how you're seeing teams bridge this gap in practice?
```

**Option B (Learning Voice):**
```
What I'm finding building in this space: the teams that get this right aren't the ones with the smartest models. They're the ones who invest in context infrastructure.

The "contextual compass" framing resonates. At my last company, I was connecting Uber/Lyft/DoorDash APIs before "AI tool use" was a thing. The insight then is the same insight now — selecting the right tool for the context matters more than having every tool available.

How are you seeing product and engineering orgs align on who owns that context layer?
```

**Option C (Direct/Shorter):**
```
This divide is real. Spent years watching engineers optimize for capability while product people optimized for usability — and the gap only gets wider with AI.

The teams I'm seeing win are the ones treating context as infrastructure, not an afterthought. "Contextual compass" is a great frame for what that looks like in practice.
```

### 2. Mike Steadman - Building in Public vs Stealth Mode ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY

**Author:** "IRON" Mike Steadman (Category Designer & Venture Partner)
**Posted:** 37 minutes ago
**Reactions:** 3
**Comments:** 3
**Tags:** #VeteranEntrepreneurs

**Post Summary:**
"A lot of founders hide behind 'stealth mode,' but you don't need to share your product in order to gain traction, just your problem. Most first-time founders, especially vets, are scared to share."

**Why Engage:**
- Very low competition (3 comments)
- #VeteranEntrepreneurs tag = perfect for DJ's Marine background
- Building in public is core content pillar
- Category designer = interesting potential connection

**Comment Options:**

**Option A (Veteran + Builder Angle):**
```
This hits different coming from the vet founder community. The Marine Corps taught me to share problems early — you're not asking for help, you're inviting collaboration. But translating that to "building in public" as a solo founder? That took unlearning.

What helped me: separating "the problem I'm solving" from "the thing I'm building." Talking about the problem constantly. Talking about the product... selectively. You get the traction without the vulnerability of shipping unfinished work into the void.

What's been your experience coaching vet founders through this shift?
```

**Option B (Problem-First Framing):**
```
"Share your problem, not your product" — this is the unlock most founders miss.

Building BuildOS, I spent months hiding behind "stealth mode" before realizing: nobody cares about your solution until they feel the problem. Now I talk about context engineering and AI memory constantly. The product is almost secondary.

The vet founder hesitation is real though. We're trained to execute, not to market ourselves. Curious what you've seen work to shift that mindset?
```

**Option C (Shorter/Direct):**
```
The distinction between sharing your problem vs sharing your product is everything. Stealth mode on the solution, loud on the problem.

As a vet founder myself — the "scared to share" part resonates. We're trained for operational security, not public vulnerability. Building in public required completely rewiring that instinct.
```

### 3. Falak Soomro - ChatGPT Connectors Review

**Author:** Falak Soomro
**Posted:** Fresh (within hours)
**Topic:** Review of ChatGPT's new Connectors feature

**Post Summary:**
Reviewing ChatGPT's Connectors feature for integrating with external tools and data sources.

**Why Engage:**
- Relevant to AI productivity/workflow space
- Lower competition than Tier 1 accounts
- Opportunity to share perspective on AI tool integration

**Comment Options:**

**Option A (Experience-Based):**
```
What I keep wondering with these connector approaches: who owns the context layer?

At Curri, I was building integrations between Uber/Lyft/DoorDash APIs before "AI tool use" was trendy. The hard problem was never connecting the tools — it was knowing which tool to use when, and carrying context between them.

Connectors solve the plumbing. But the "when to use what" problem is where most AI workflows fall apart. Have you seen anything in how ChatGPT handles context persistence across connector calls?
```

**Option B (Shorter):**
```
Connectors are interesting but I'm more curious about the context layer underneath. Does it remember which connectors you've used and why?

The integration is the easy part. Context persistence is where most AI tool setups fall apart in practice.
```

### 4. Lenny Rachitsky - Best of Newsletter 2026 (Optional)

**Author:** Lenny Rachitsky
**Posted:** 22 hours ago
**Comments:** 58
**Type:** Newsletter retrospective

**Why Borderline:**
- 58 comments = harder to stand out
- 22 hours old = past prime algorithm window
- Tier 1 account = worth engaging if you have something substantial

**Comment Option (Only if time allows):**
```
The product thinking posts always stand out. What I appreciate about your approach: you treat product decisions as learnable patterns, not tribal knowledge.

Building as a solo founder, I keep coming back to your frameworks when I'm stuck on prioritization. The "how to say no" piece especially — most productivity tools are built for managers. The ones that work for makers have to be opinionated about what NOT to do.
```
