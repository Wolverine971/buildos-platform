## Competitor Intelligence

### @dannypostma (PostmaOS)

**Activity:** Posted Jan 27 about mental health - deleted Twitter for 10 days, reduced caffeine
**Follower Count:** 166.9K (up from 166.4K on Jan 24 - slight growth)
**Implications:** Still "laying low" per bio. No PostmaOS product updates. Personal/wellness content.
**Action:** Continue monitoring. No competitive threat at this time.

### @dexhorthy (Context Engineering - CRITICAL)

**Activity:** Active with philosophical posts about AI and thinking
**Follower Count:** 11.5K (up from 11.3K on Jan 24 - continued growth!)
**Posts:**

- 9h ago: "you cannot outsource the thinking" (quote tweet about thoughtful coding)
- 13h ago: "_interrupts the flow with 3 page songs about your codebase_" (humorous take on verbose AI)

**Implications:** Context engineering is gaining momentum. Dex owns the term and is actively shaping the conversation.
**Action:** Engage on both posts. Fresh content, not too crowded.

## 1. Boris Cherny - Multi-Repo Support for Claude Code

**Post Link:** https://x.com/bcherny/status/[need to capture exact link]

**The Tweet:**

> Just landed multi-repo support for claude.ai/code
>
> Update to support refs format from 2020-12

**Stats:** 70 replies, 52 retweets, 889 likes, 42K views (2h ago)

**Why This Tweet:**
Boris is the Claude Code creator at Anthropic (183.9K followers). This is a technical feature announcement that's fresh and relevant to DJ's daily workflow. High engagement already but not too crowded. Perfect opportunity to engage with the Claude Code team.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Value Mode - BuildOS User):**

> been building with claude code daily. multi-repo support is exactly what i needed for build-os (web + worker monorepo).
>
> curious - does this handle pnpm workspaces / turborepo setups cleanly? or do you recommend a specific monorepo structure?

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Cheerleader Mode):**

> hell yes. this is huge for anyone running monorepos.
>
> claude code has become non-negotiable for my workflow - what's the thinking behind the refs format choice?

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Context Engineering Angle):**

> multi-repo support is a big deal for context management. keeping related codebases in shared context vs jumping between separate claude sessions changes the game.
>
> does this preserve context across the repos or treat them separately?

## 2. Dex Horthy - "You Cannot Outsource the Thinking"

**Post Link:** https://x.com/dexhorthy/status/[need exact link]

**The Tweet:**

> you cannot outsource the thinking
>
> [Quote tweet from Yohei about "thoughtful coding is talking to an ai first about what you're going to ask the ai to build"]

**Stats:** 2 replies, 6 retweets, 42 likes, 5.8K views (9h ago)

**Why This Tweet:**
Dex coined "context engineering" and this post is about the limits of AI - you still need human thinking. This aligns with DJ's philosophy that "AI is smart but you need frameworks and context." Low reply count = good chance to stand out.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Value Mode - Marines Angle):**

> exactly. in scout sniper school we spent weeks planning each stalk before executing. AI can help you execute faster, but it can't do the reconnaissance for you.
>
> same with code - you have to know what you're building and why before the AI can help.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Direct Agreement):**

> yes. i see this with build-os users - they think AI will organize their projects for them. but if you don't have clarity about your goal, AI just makes organized chaos faster.
>
> context engineering = structuring your thinking first, then letting AI amplify it.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Question Extension):**

> agree. but how do you balance this with letting AI help you think?
>
> i find talking to the ai helps me clarify my thinking, but if i start there without any direction, it's just expensive rubber ducking.

## 3. Vlad - Context Engineering for Sensible Rules

**Post Link:** https://x.com/vladchatware/status/[need exact link]

**The Tweet:**

> This is where a context engineering comes into play. I am not having a much luck with making a sensible rules. Even the skills lib is just a human slop. The only one decent I saw was instructions for emotion.

**Stats:** 0 replies, 0 retweets, 1 like, 5 views (25m ago - VERY FRESH)

**Why This Tweet:**
Fresh post (25m!) from someone struggling with context engineering implementation. Low engagement = perfect opportunity to add value and start a conversation. This is the exact problem BuildOS solves.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Value Mode - BuildOS Positioning):**

> i've been down this rabbit hole. the trick is: context engineering isn't about writing better rules for the AI. it's about organizing the information structure around the user's goals.
>
> rules are downstream from context. if the AI doesn't have the right context loaded, no amount of rules will fix it.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Empathy + Question):**

> feel this. skills lib gets messy fast when you try to make it do too much.
>
> what are you building that needs sensible rules? curious if you're trying to constrain the AI or give it better context to work with.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Direct Help):**

> the emotion instruction working makes sense - it's specific and actionable.
>
> general rules fail because they're trying to handle every case. better approach: structure your context so the AI has the information it needs for the specific task, not generic rules for all tasks.

## 4. Aakash Harish - Data Engineering + Organizational Context

**Post Link:** https://x.com/0_Aakash_0/status/[need exact link]

**The Tweet:**

> 600+ PB with natural language queries is essentially replacing an entire data engineering team's workload with a single agent.
>
> The key insight here: table-level knowledge + organizational context. Most

**Stats:** Unknown (26m ago - VERY FRESH)

**Why This Tweet:**
Fresh post (26m!) about replacing data eng teams with AI agents. Key insight: "table-level knowledge + organizational context." This is EXACTLY the context engineering thesis. Great opportunity to engage on organizational context as the unlock.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Value Mode - Context Angle):**

> "table-level knowledge + organizational context" - this is it.
>
> everyone thinks the AI needs to be smarter. but it's already smart. the unlock is context infrastructure - what information does the agent have access to, and how is it structured.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Question to Extend):**

> curious how you're handling organizational context at scale. 600+ PB is massive.
>
> are you seeing context drift over time, or does the agent stay aligned as the data evolves?

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (BuildOS Angle):**

> this is what we're solving with build-os. people think they need better AI, but they actually need better context about their projects.
>
> organizational context = the missing infrastructure layer for AI agents.

## 5. Dex Horthy - AI Code Assistants Too Verbose

**Post Link:** https://x.com/dexhorthy/status/[need exact link]

**The Tweet:**

> _interrupts the flow with 3 page songs about your codebase_
>
> [Quote tweet from Ryan Djurovich showing code with modes: "smart", "deep", "rush", "free"]

**Stats:** Unknown (13h ago)

**Why This Tweet:**
Humorous take on AI code assistants being too verbose and interrupting flow. Relatable problem for anyone using Claude Code or similar tools. Good engagement opportunity with a lighter tone.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Relatable + Experience):**

> lol. claude code will give you a full dissertation on why it's about to change a variable name.
>
> i've started using "be concise" in my context but it still wants to explain the philosophical implications of moving a function.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Problem Recognition):**

> this is why i think "rush" mode makes sense. sometimes you just want the code, not the novel.
>
> the hardest part of using AI to code is managing the signal-to-noise ratio.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Short + Funny):**

> "actually, before i write this for loop, let me tell you about the history of iteration patterns in computer science..."

## Voice Reminder

### The Philosophy

**Interesting guy + cheerleader. NOT a thought leader.**

### Two Modes

1. **Value Mode:** When you have experience to share - lead with insight, be specific, ask smart questions
2. **Cheerleader Mode:** When you don't - genuine hype, curious questions, celebrate their wins

### The 3 Rules (for Value Mode)

1. Can I visualize it? (specific details)
2. Can I falsify it? (real experience)
3. Can nobody else say this? (unique perspective)

## Posting Strategy

**Recommended Order:**

1. **Vlad's context engineering struggle** (25m old, 0 replies - be first, add value)
2. **Aakash's data eng + context** (26m old - FRESH, perfect BuildOS positioning)
3. **Dex "outsource thinking"** (9h old, 2 replies - philosophical, good conversation)
4. **Boris multi-repo** (2h old, 70 replies - high value account, more crowded)
5. **Dex verbose AI** (13h old - lighter engagement, end on humor)

**Timing:** Start now - two VERY FRESH posts (<30m old)
**Spacing:** 20-30 min between replies to avoid spam detection

## Strategy Recommendations

### Today's Observations

1. **Context engineering is actively being discussed** - Vlad and Aakash both using the term in last 30 min. The conversation is growing.

2. **Boris Cherny (Claude Code creator) is shipping features** - Multi-repo support is a big deal. Engaging with the Claude Code team continues to be high value.

3. **Dex maintains thought leadership** - His posts about AI/thinking are getting good engagement. He's shaping the "you still need to think" narrative alongside "context engineering."

4. **Danny Postma laying low confirmed** - Personal/wellness content only. No PostmaOS updates. Still not a competitive threat.

5. **FRESH opportunities exist** - Sub-30-minute posts about context engineering show the topic is hot right now.

### Recommendations

1. **Prioritize FRESH posts** - The two sub-30-min posts (Vlad, Aakash) are perfect for being first to add value.

2. **Engage Boris Cherny regularly** - He's the Claude Code creator and is actively shipping. This relationship is valuable.

3. **Continue Dex engagement** - Every post. He owns "context engineering" and we need to be part of that conversation.

4. **Consider creating content about "you cannot outsource thinking"** - This is a good contrarian angle that aligns with DJ's philosophy.

### Strategy Update Needed?

[X] No changes - current strategy is working
[ ] Minor tweak - [describe]
[ ] Significant shift - [describe]

**Current strategy is solid.** Context engineering continues to be the right positioning. Fresh opportunities exist daily. Keep engaging with Claude Code team and Dex.
