## Top Engagement Opportunities

### 1. Jacob Stiglitz - "Building While Life Happens" (Score: 95)

**Link:** Feed post (search "Jacob Stiglitz CommonWeal")
**Author:** Jacob Stiglitz | Building CommonWeal in public | AI for founders with gumption
**Age:** 42m | **Comments:** Low (~0-4)

**The Post:**

> I spent the last two weeks moving cities and helping my parents with health stuff. Not the sexy startup story. No "crushing it" energy. Just the reality of building while life happens...

**Why This Post:**
PERFECT Building in Public pillar alignment. Fresh post, low competition. Authentic founder content about the messy reality of building - exactly the kind of content DJ resonates with.

**Option A (Cheerleader Mode):**

> This is the content that actually matters. The "crushing it" narrative does a disservice to everyone building something real. Life doesn't pause for your startup, and pretending otherwise just makes everyone else feel like they're failing. Rooting for you and CommonWeal - what you're building sounds fascinating.

**Option B (Value + Cheerleader):**

> Really appreciate the honesty here. I've had similar stretches with BuildOS where life takes priority and the grind has to flex around it. What I'm finding is that those "unproductive" periods often give you clarity you wouldn't get heads-down in the code. The sexy startup story is a myth anyway - the real story is people building while navigating everything else. Keep going.

**Option C (Cheerleader - Shorter):**

> "Building while life happens" - this is the actual founder journey nobody posts about. The messy middle, the interruptions, the real stuff. Rooting for you.

### 2. Ethan Mollick - Google/Gemini AI Research Paper (Score: 88)

**Link:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/emollick/recent-activity/all/
**Author:** Ethan Mollick | Associate Professor at The Wharton School | Author of Co-Intelligence
**Age:** 2h | **Reactions:** 66 | **Comments:** 8

**The Post:**

> New paper from Google on accelerating science using Gemini (as opposed to its specialized research AIs). Lots of case studies as well interesting and useful advice on ways to work with these systems...
>
> Techniques for AI-Assisted Research:
>
> - Iterative Prompting and Refinement
> - Specific Sub-tasks
> - Error Correction
> - Scaffolding
> - Adversarial Self-Correction for Review

**Why This Post:**
Tier 1 account, AI/Context Engineering adjacent. The "techniques" angle connects to DJ's belief that AI needs frameworks, not just intelligence. Low enough comments to still be visible.

**Option A (Value Mode):**

> The "Specific Sub-tasks" and "Scaffolding" points resonate with what I'm seeing building in the AI productivity space. The gap between "AI is smart" and "AI is useful" is almost entirely about giving it structured context and frameworks to work within. Raw intelligence that resets every session is impressive but not productive. Curious if the paper addresses how these techniques compound over time or if each session still starts fresh.

**Option B (Value - Shorter):**

> What strikes me about these techniques is they're all about structuring context, not prompting harder. "Scaffolding" and "Iterative Refinement" are essentially context engineering by another name. The insight that keeps emerging: AI productivity isn't about smarter models, it's about better frameworks for context.

**Option C (Cheerleader + Question):**

> Really valuable synthesis of practical techniques here. The "Error Correction" and "Adversarial Self-Correction" patterns are ones I keep coming back to. Did the paper get into how researchers handle context/memory across longer projects, or is this mostly session-by-session?

### 3. Louis Byun - Gemini AI Agent Implementation (Score: 85)

**Link:** Search "Louis Byun Gemini AI Agent" on LinkedIn
**Author:** Louis Byun | Software Engineer | Automation Anywhere Certified Master
**Age:** ~5m (VERY FRESH) | **Comments:** 0

**The Post:**

> Gemini AI Agent — Full-Stack Cloud-Native Implementation
>
> I'm thrilled to share a project that moves beyond the "notebook demo"...
> [GitHub - louisbyun/aiAgent]

**Why This Post:**
FRESH post about moving beyond demos to real implementation. Perfect for context engineering angle - "notebook demo" vs real production is exactly the gap BuildOS addresses.

**Option A (Value Mode):**

> "Moves beyond the notebook demo" - this is the conversation that matters. The gap between impressive demos and daily-driver tools is enormous, and it's almost always about context and state management. What's your approach to handling context persistence across sessions? That's where I see most agent projects hit the wall.

**Option B (Cheerleader + Curiosity):**

> Love that you're tackling the "beyond the demo" problem. The notebook-to-production gap is real and undersold in the AI agent discourse. Excited to dig into the repo - what was the hardest part of making it production-ready?

**Option C (Value - Technical):**

> The "full-stack cloud-native" framing is interesting - most agent implementations I see are still treating infrastructure as an afterthought. Curious how you're handling agent memory and context across invocations. That's where the demo-to-real gap usually shows up.

### 4. Dexter Horthy - "Anthropic Doesn't Know How to Yield" (Score: 82)

**Link:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/dexterihorthy/recent-activity/all/
**Author:** Dexter Horthy | "we are in an asymmetric war on slop" | 11,234 followers
**Age:** 2d | **Reactions:** 8 | **Comments:** 2

**The Post:**

> do not miss an oppty to work with secemp. incredible post. generational builder
>
> [Shares: Allison Durham's article "Anthropic Doesn't Know How to Yield" about Claude Code freezing issues]

**Why This Post:**
Dexter Horthy COINED "Context Engineering" - he's the originator of the term that's central to BuildOS positioning. Low competition (2 comments), directly relevant to the Claude Code ecosystem DJ uses daily.

**Option A (Value Mode):**

> The yield/freezing issue is something I've hit building with Claude Code. What's interesting is that it's a symptom of the broader context management challenge - these tools are incredibly powerful but still fundamentally session-bound. The "context that compounds" problem hasn't been solved yet. Appreciate you sharing this - and appreciate your work on context engineering more broadly. It's the frame that makes sense of all of this.

**Option B (Value - Shorter):**

> Hit this exact freezing issue last week. The deeper problem feels like context/state management at scale - same challenge as getting agents to remember anything useful across sessions. Good share, and thanks for coining "context engineering" - it's become the lens I think through everything in this space.

**Option C (Cheerleader):**

> Great share. Allison's debugging work is impressive, and the yield issue is something a lot of us have quietly been frustrated by. Appreciate you surfacing the quality content in this space - your "war on slop" framing is exactly right.

### 5. Bloomr.World - User Research Learnings (Score: 80)

**Link:** Search "#BuildingInPublic" latest posts
**Author:** Bloomr.World | 127 followers
**Age:** ~1m (VERY FRESH) | **Comments:** 0

**The Post:**

> Sharing some learnings from our ongoing experiment:
>
> We talked to a bunch of our users and learned that those who are...

**Why This Post:**
Very fresh Building in Public content about user research. Perfect for cheerleader mode engagement with a smaller account.

**Option A (Cheerleader Mode):**

> Love that you're sharing the learnings as you go. Building in public with actual user insights is so much more valuable than vanity metrics updates. What surprised you most from the conversations?

**Option B (Cheerleader + Value):**

> This is the good stuff - actual user conversations, not just feature announcements. What I've learned building my own thing is that the patterns you think you'll find in user research are rarely the ones that actually matter. What was the most unexpected insight?

### 6. Dan Shipper - AI-Native Companies (Score: 75)

**Link:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/danshipper/recent-activity/all/
**Author:** Dan Shipper | Co-founder / CEO at Every
**Age:** 1d | **Reactions:** 54 | **Comments:** 6

**The Post:**

> if your company to go AI-native, you shouldn't use professional consultants...
>
> Every Consulting is officially open for Q1. We work with tech and finance teams to implement AI across...

**Why This Post:**
Tier 1 account, AI productivity space leader. Promotional content but touches on the AI implementation gap that's relevant.

**Option A (Value Mode):**

> The "professional consultants" point is interesting - the challenge I see is that most AI implementation advice is still tool-focused when it should be context-focused. You can throw all the latest models at a problem, but if you're not building persistent context about the work and the people doing it, you're just doing expensive demos. What's Every's approach to the context/memory layer?

**Option B (Shorter - Question):**

> Curious how Every thinks about the context/memory problem in AI implementation. The tool layer is getting commoditized fast - the real differentiation seems to be in how you build and maintain organizational context. Is that part of the consulting framework?

## Voice Reminder

### The Philosophy

**Interesting guy + cheerleader. NOT a thought leader.**

### Two Modes

1. **Value Mode** - When you have experience/insight: Share specific experience, lead with curiosity, "What I'm finding..." not "The answer is..."
2. **Cheerleader Mode** - When you don't: Genuine excitement, specific praise, curious questions, "We're all rowing the same boat" energy

### The 3 Quality Tests

1. Can I visualize it? (Specific details)
2. Can I falsify it? (Real experience)
3. Can nobody else say this? (Unique perspective from BuildOS, Curri, Marines)
