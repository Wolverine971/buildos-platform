## Top Engagement Opportunities

### 1. Mark Starkman - ADHD "Cycle of Doom" (Score: 95)

**Link:** Search "Mark Starkman ADHD" on LinkedIn (recent posts)
**Author:** Mark Starkman | Tech Leader | ADHD entrepreneur content
**Age:** ~30m | **Reactions:** 1 | **Comments:** 0

**The Post:**

> The ADHD "Cycle of Doom" for entrepreneurs - describing the burnout pattern of hyperfocus → crash → guilt → avoidance that ADHD founders experience...

**Why This Post:**
PERFECT ADHD/Scattered Minds pillar alignment. Extremely fresh with zero comments - first mover advantage. This is the kind of authentic ADHD content that DJ can connect with from personal experience. The "Cycle of Doom" framing is specific and resonant.

**Option A (Value + Cheerleader):**

> This cycle is so real it hurts. The hyperfocus-to-guilt loop is something I've learned to work WITH instead of against while building BuildOS. What helped me was building systems that capture the hyperfocus output before the crash hits - so when you come back around, you're not starting from zero. The "doom" part gets smaller when the good work doesn't disappear. Appreciate you naming this so clearly.

**Option B (Cheerleader Mode):**

> The fact that you named this so specifically matters. Most ADHD content is either "here's a hack" or "you're valid" - this actually describes the MECHANISM that makes building so hard. The guilt → avoidance link is the one nobody talks about. Thanks for putting this out there.

**Option C (Value - Shorter):**

> This is the pattern. What I've found building my own thing is that the cycle gets less destructive when you have systems that preserve your hyperfocus output. The crash still comes, but you don't lose the work. Naming it is the first step though - appreciate this.

### 2. Yhoni David Hilton-Shomron - Neurodivergent UX Perspective (Score: 90)

**Link:** Search "Yhoni David Hilton-Shomron LinkedIn" (recent posts)
**Author:** Yhoni David Hilton-Shomron | UX/Neurodivergent advocate
**Age:** ~30m | **Reactions:** 1 | **Comments:** 0

**The Post:**

> "When LinkedIn Breaks Your Learning Workflow: A Neurodivergent UX Perspective" - discussing how platform UX patterns fail neurodivergent users and disrupt learning workflows...

**Why This Post:**
Fresh ADHD/neurodivergent content with a UX/product angle. Zero comments. Connects DJ's ADHD pillar with his product-building perspective - the intersection of neurodivergent needs and software design is exactly what BuildOS addresses.

**Option A (Value Mode):**

> This resonates deeply. I'm building a productivity tool specifically because most apps are designed for neurotypical workflows - linear, sequential, "capture everything in the right place." Real neurodivergent work is messy, nonlinear, and context-dependent. The UX patterns that work for most people actively fight against how my brain operates. What specific patterns do you think would actually serve neurodivergent learners?

**Option B (Cheerleader + Curiosity):**

> YES. The gap between how platforms are designed and how neurodivergent brains actually process information is massive and undersold. Most productivity UX assumes you'll follow a linear path - which is the exact opposite of how my brain works. Really glad someone is articulating this from a UX lens. What's the biggest offender you've found?

**Option C (Cheerleader - Shorter):**

> This needed to be said. The neurodivergent UX gap is real and most platforms don't even acknowledge it exists. Following for more of this perspective.

### 3. Alex Lieberman - Claude Code Community (Score: 85)

**Link:** Search "Alex Lieberman Claude Code" on LinkedIn
**Author:** Alex Lieberman | Co-founder Morning Brew | 330K+ followers
**Age:** 1d | **Reactions:** 46 | **Comments:** 9

**The Post:**

> "Claude Code Community is the biggest unfair advantage in my professional life right now" - discussing the value of the Claude Code community and tools ecosystem...

**Why This Post:**
Morning Brew cofounder talking about Claude Code - directly relevant to Context Engineering pillar and DJ's daily workflow. Large account (330K followers) but still manageable comments (9). Great opportunity to share perspective from someone who builds with Claude Code daily.

**Option A (Value Mode):**

> Can confirm - been building with Claude Code daily for months and the community around it has accelerated everything. What's interesting is that the "unfair advantage" isn't the tool itself, it's the shared context and patterns people are building around it. The model is the same for everyone - the difference is in how you structure context for it. That's where the community compounds.

**Option B (Value - Shorter):**

> Building with Claude Code daily and totally agree. The advantage isn't the tool - it's the accumulated context and patterns the community shares. Everyone has the same model, the differentiator is context engineering. That's what compounds.

**Option C (Cheerleader + Question):**

> 100% agree. What's your workflow look like? I've been deep in Claude Code for BuildOS and the biggest unlock has been treating it as a context problem, not a prompting problem. Curious what patterns you've found most valuable.

### 4. Ethan Mollick - Genie 3 Visual Worlds (Score: 78)

**Link:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/emollick/recent-activity/all/
**Author:** Ethan Mollick | Associate Professor at The Wharton School | Author of Co-Intelligence
**Age:** 13h | **Reactions:** 103 | **Comments:** 15

**The Post:**

> Sharing Genie 3 creating visually interesting worlds with Midjourney images - AI-generated 3D environments from 2D images...

**Why This Post:**
Tier 1 account, AI creativity/capability post. 15 comments is manageable for visibility. Different from yesterday's Gemini paper post - this is more about AI creative capabilities than research techniques.

**Option A (Value Mode):**

> The gap between "impressive demo" and "daily-use tool" is still massive, but it's closing faster in creative applications than anywhere else. What I keep noticing is that the tools that actually get adopted aren't the most technically impressive - they're the ones that fit into existing workflows. Curious whether Genie 3 has that quality or if it's still in "wow, look at this" territory.

**Option B (Cheerleader + Question):**

> The visual quality jump is genuinely impressive. What I'm most curious about is whether these tools change the creative PROCESS or just the production speed. Does having AI-generated environments change how people think about world-building, or is it mostly accelerating what they'd do anyway?

**Option C (Value - Shorter):**

> The demo-to-workflow gap is the question with all of these. Beautiful output, but the real test is whether it changes how people actually create, not just how fast. Impressive regardless.

### 5. David Mlcoch - "After 3 Frontend Rebuilds" (Score: 76)

**Link:** Search "David Mlcoch asteroid" on LinkedIn
**Author:** David Mlcoch | Founder & CEO @ asteroid | YC W25
**Age:** 1d | **Reactions:** 37 | **Comments:** 7

**The Post:**

> "After 3 frontend rebuilds, we finally landed on a UI that actually works" - sharing the journey of iterating on their product's frontend as a YC W25 startup...

**Why This Post:**
Building in Public pillar alignment from a YC founder. The "3 rebuilds" narrative is authentic and resonant - DJ knows the pain of iterating on UI. Low enough comments (7) to still be visible.

**Option A (Value + Cheerleader):**

> Three rebuilds is real. I've been through similar iterations with BuildOS and what I've learned is that the first two builds teach you what the UI SHOULDN'T be. You can't skip that process. The "finally works" version always has lessons from the failures baked in. What was the biggest thing that changed between rebuild 2 and 3?

**Option B (Cheerleader Mode):**

> Love the honesty. "After 3 rebuilds" is the real startup story - not "we nailed it first try." Congrats on finding what works. That persistence through iteration is what separates the ones who ship from the ones who don't.

**Option C (Value - Shorter):**

> The 3-rebuild journey is so real. Each one teaches you something you couldn't have learned without building the wrong thing first. Congrats on landing it - what was the unlock?

### 6. Dexter Horthy - OpenClaw Unhackathon Repost (Score: 72)

**Link:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/dexterihorthy/recent-activity/all/
**Author:** Dexter Horthy | "we are in an asymmetric war on slop" | 11,234 followers
**Age:** 3h (repost) | **Comments:** ~0

**The Post:**

> Repost of OpenClaw Unhackathon content - community/hackathon activity in the AI space...

**Why This Post:**
Dexter coined "Context Engineering" - relationship-building priority. Fresh repost with no comments means high visibility. Even a quick engagement here keeps the connection warm. Lower score because it's a repost rather than original content.

**Option A (Cheerleader):**

> The Unhackathon concept is interesting - feels like a reaction to the "build something in 24 hours and never touch it again" model. What's the format look like?

**Option B (Cheerleader - Shorter):**

> This looks cool. What's the Unhackathon format? Always curious about alternatives to the standard hackathon model.

## Voice Reminder

### The Philosophy

**Interesting guy + cheerleader. NOT a thought leader.**

### Two Modes

1. **Value Mode** - When you have experience/insight: Share specific experience, lead with curiosity, "What I'm finding..." not "The answer is..."
2. **Cheerleader Mode** - When you don't: Genuine excitement, specific praise, curious questions, "We're all rowing the same boat" energy

### The 3 Quality Tests

1. Can I visualize it? (Specific details)
2. Can I falsify it? (Real experience)
3. Can nobody else say this? (Unique perspective from BuildOS, Curri, Marines)
