## 1. Anthropic Context Engineering Guide - MUST ENGAGE

**Trending Topic:** Anthropic published "Effective Context Engineering for AI Agents"

**Why This Matters:**
Anthropic just dropped a major guide on context engineering. This is YOUR topic. They're saying exactly what you've been building toward: "Context engineering is the natural progression of prompt engineering... the set of strategies for curating and maintaining the optimal set of tokens during LLM inference."

**Search for posts about:** `"context engineering" anthropic -is:retweet lang:en`

**Key Quote to Reference:**

> "Most agent failures are not model failures anymore—they are context failures."

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Insider validation):**

> anthropic nailed it: "most agent failures are not model failures—they are context failures."
>
> been saying this for months. you can swap models all day. but if the agent doesn't know your project history, constraints, past decisions... it's just impressive autocomplete.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Building angle):**

> context engineering > prompt engineering. anthropic gets it.
>
> this is exactly why i'm building build-os. the intelligence is a commodity now. your context is the moat.
>
> shameless plug but this validation feels good.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Direct + punchy):**

> the era of "just write better prompts" is over.
>
> context engineering is the new skill. and most people aren't ready for it.

## 2. AI Memory Problem - Direct Pain Point

**Trending Topic:** "The Memory Problem: Why Your AI App Keeps Forgetting"

**Why This Matters:**
This Indie Hackers post and Medium articles are getting traction. The exact pain point BuildOS solves. Quote: "A legal AI that forgets case details, a coding assistant that can't recall your project structure, a customer service bot that asks for the same information repeatedly."

**Search for posts about:** `AI "keeps forgetting" context -is:retweet lang:en`

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Validate + extend):**

> "your agent has the memory of a goldfish combined with an overconfidence problem"
>
> this is the whole game. AI is smart as fuck now. but smart with amnesia is just expensive autocomplete.
>
> context that compounds > intelligence that resets.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Experience-based):**

> lived this at curri. built integrations connecting uber, lyft, doordash APIs. the system needed to know search history, driver patterns, fallback criteria.
>
> without memory of past decisions, every call was a fresh guess. same problem with AI agents now.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (BuildOS plug natural):**

> this is why i built build-os.
>
> got tired of pasting the same context into chatgpt every time. "here's my brand strategy. here's what we decided last week. here's the constraint you forgot."
>
> the future isn't smarter AI. it's AI that remembers.

## 3. Building in Public Debate - Contrarian Opportunity

**Trending Topic:** "Is this the end of Build in Public? Top indie hackers are disappearing."

**Why This Matters:**
Hot debate on IH and Twitter. Levelsio, Danny Postma, others going into "revenue ghost mode" to avoid copycats. Good opportunity for contrarian take about what BIP actually means.

**Search for posts about:** `"building in public" dead 2026 -is:retweet lang:en`

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Contrarian take):**

> building in public isn't dead. sharing MRR screenshots is dead.
>
> the valuable part was never the numbers. it's the thinking. the decisions. the "here's what i was wrong about."
>
> levelsio going stealth doesn't mean BIP failed. it means it evolved.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Personal angle):**

> i get why founders are going dark. copycats are real.
>
> but i'm still building in public because the value isn't the product details - it's the journey. the pivots. the "daily briefs flopped, here's what i learned."
>
> nobody can copy your thinking.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Direct observation):**

> building in public created a genre problem: everyone built for other indie hackers.
>
> now we're all competing for the same "dev tools for devs" market.
>
> the lesson isn't "stop sharing." it's "build for people outside the echo chamber."

## 4. ADHD Productivity Tools Trending

**Trending Topic:** Tiimo wins iPhone App of the Year 2025, ADHD productivity discussions

**Search for posts about:** `ADHD productivity app overwhelmed -is:retweet lang:en`

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Validate the struggle):**

>
> the tool that's supposed to help becomes another thing demanding your attention. another inbox. another red badge.
>

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Personal experience):**

> my wife thinks i have ADHD. don't know for sure.
>
> but i know this: every productivity tool i've tried becomes a graveyard within 6 months. notion. obsidian. apple notes. moleskines.
>
> the answer isn't another tool. it's a system that talks back and keeps you focused.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (BuildOS angle):**

> the adhd brain doesn't need more organization. it needs clarity.
>
> most tools make you organize TO think. the future is tools that help you think THEN organize for you.
>
> this is why i'm building build-os. brain dump first, structure second.

>

**Trending Topic:** "AI agents arrived in 2025 - here's the challenges ahead in 2026"

**Why This Matters:**

**Search for posts about:** `AI agents 2026 challenges -is:retweet lang:en`

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Context angle):**

> "agents are only as good as the context they operate in"
>
> this is the whole ball game for 2026. everyone's building smarter agents. few are building better context infrastructure.
>
> intelligence is cheap. context is the moat.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Practical insight):**

> the ai agents hype is real. the execution gap is realer.
>
> saw this at curri building integrations. you can connect all the APIs you want. without the right context about when to use what, it's just noise.
>
> same problem scaled up now.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Prediction):**

> 2026 prediction: the winners won't be whoever builds the smartest agent.
>
> it'll be whoever builds the best context layer. the memory. the history. the "what does this user actually need right now."
>
> model swaps are commoditized. context isn't.

## Posting Strategy

### From Live Scan (Do These First)

1. **Sam's community thread (3h)** - Best opportunity, founder wisdom, 19 replies still engageable
2. **Lenny's culture post (4h)** - Solo founder angle is unique
3. **Sam's thumbnail (2h)** - Quick hit if you have time

### Topic Searches (If time permits)

1. **Context Engineering (Anthropic)** - Search `"context engineering" anthropic -is:retweet lang:en`
2. **AI Memory Problem** - Search `AI "keeps forgetting" context -is:retweet lang:en`
3. **ADHD Productivity** - Search `ADHD productivity overwhelmed -is:retweet lang:en`

**Timing:**

- Space replies 30+ min apart
- Don't reply to all at once (looks spammy)

**Note:** Tier 1 accounts were light today - levelsio and swyx had no posts in 24h, Shaan/Dan posts already covered yesterday.

## Voice Reminder

### The 3 Rules

1. Can I visualize it?
2. Can I falsify it?
3. Can nobody else say this?

### Quick Don'ts

- No "love this" or "great post"
- No preachy setups
- No generic observations anyone could make

### Your Unique Angles

- Curri integrations experience (tool use before AI made it trendy)
- Marines background (use sparingly - "a nice little treat")
- Solo founder shipping fast
- "Blue collar software engineering" - tinker, work, build
