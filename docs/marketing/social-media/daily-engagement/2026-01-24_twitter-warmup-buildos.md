## 1. Kuldeep Sisodia (@kulshows) - Notion Overwhelming

**Post Link:** https://x.com/kulshows/status/2013906705365553297

**The Tweet:**

> I tried Notion, but It's too overwhelming. I really don't need AI and tons of useless features for note taking. note taking should be as simple as Apple notes.
>
> [Replying to @NotionHQ's Agent announcement]

**Stats:** 1 reply, 1 like, 19 views (Jan 21, 2026)

**Opportunity Type:** Tool Frustration - PERFECT FIT

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
This is replying directly to Notion's official account complaining about overwhelm. @build_os already replied "agreed" on Jan 22 but that's a weak engagement. Could follow up with something more valuable.

**Current @build_os Reply:**

> "agreed"

**Suggested Follow-Up Option 1 (Add value):**

> the irony of a "tidying" update that still requires you to understand agent workflows, steps, and AI prompts.
>
> simplicity shouldn't need a tutorial.

**Suggested Follow-Up Option 2 (Direct product angle - use sparingly):**

> this is exactly why we built buildos differently. no databases. no templates. just dump your thoughts and get clarity.
>
> (shameless plug but genuinely built for people who feel this way about notion)

**Suggested Follow-Up Option 3 (Question to continue convo):**

> curious - what did you actually need from notion? just notes, or were you trying to organize projects/tasks too?
>
> because those are very different problems with very different solutions.

## 2. Lucy Patient (@NoMoreWaitingVA) - AI Memory Frustration

**Post Link:** https://x.com/NoMoreWaitingVA (Jan 7 post)

**The Tweet:**

> The major difference with #ChatGPT and #Grok? Grok forgets everything. You have to keep repeating what you already said a billion times. There's no continuity. It's frustrating.

**Stats:** 24 views (Jan 7, 2026)

**Opportunity Type:** AI Complaint - Context/Memory Problem

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
Classic AI memory frustration. This is the exact problem BuildOS solves - AI that remembers your context. The "no continuity" complaint is perfect for the context engineering angle.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Validate + insight):**

> this is the real AI problem nobody talks about enough.
>
> smart as hell, but starts fresh every conversation. it's like having a brilliant assistant with amnesia.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Context engineering angle):**

> the memory problem is why "context engineering" is becoming a thing.
>
> AI is only as good as the context you give it. and most tools make you rebuild that context every single time.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Soft product mention):**

> this is literally why we're building buildos - AI that actually remembers what you're working on.
>
> the "new chat" problem is real. context should compound, not reset.

## 3. Pinki Singh (@devpinkisingh) - Digital Tools Kill Clarity

**Post Link:** https://x.com/devpinkisingh (Jan 11 post)

**The Tweet:**

> My most powerful productivity tool doesn't have a battery.
>
> I spend 10 hours a day in VS Code. But I realized digital tools are great for speed, yet terrible for clarity.
>
> Notifications kill deep work. "Undo" buttons kill commitment.
>
> So for 2026, I went back to basics. [planner image]

**Stats:** 74 views (Jan 11, 2026)

**Opportunity Type:** Tool Frustration - Going Analog

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
Interesting counter-position. This person went back to paper because digital tools are "terrible for clarity." BuildOS's brain dump approach actually bridges this - dump like paper, but with AI organization. However, might be better to engage authentically rather than sell.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Agree + nuance):**

> there's something real here. the "undo button kills commitment" insight is underrated.
>
> paper forces you to think before you write. most digital tools let you think by writing and deleting endlessly.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Curious question):**

> genuine question - how do you handle the stuff that needs to be searchable or shared?
>
> i keep going back and forth between paper for clarity and digital for retrieval.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (No product mention - just support):**

> this energy. the planner aesthetic is _chef's kiss_.
>
> sometimes the best productivity system is the one that doesn't fight your brain.

## 4. Vilva.ai (@VilvaOfficial) - ADHD Cognitive Overload

**Post Link:** https://x.com/VilvaOfficial (Jan 17 post)

**The Tweet:**

> Cognitive overload happens when too many tasks compete for your focus.
>
> It feels like a browser with 50 tabs open. To fix it, you have to externalize your thoughts. Get them out of your head and onto a canvas.
>
> #ADHD

**Stats:** 2 likes, 26 views (Jan 17, 2026)

**Opportunity Type:** ADHD Content - Brain Dump Angle

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
The "externalize your thoughts" advice aligns perfectly with BuildOS's brain dump philosophy. However, this is an AI/product account (Vilva.ai), so engaging might look like competitive marketing. Approach with caution.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Agree + add):**

> "externalize your thoughts" is the whole game.
>
> the hard part isn't getting them out - it's what happens next. most tools make you organize them manually, which just creates more cognitive load.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Skip - may look competitive):**
_Note: @VilvaOfficial appears to be an AI productivity tool. Engaging might come across as competitive marketing. Consider skipping unless the interaction feels authentic._

## 5. @xoxoLove_Liyah - Notion Overwhelming (Already Engaged)

**Post Link:** https://x.com/xoxoLove_Liyah/status/2013786606256205835

**The Tweet:**

> How are people using notion?? I'm very type A, so I feel like I would enjoy it, but it's so overwhelming

**Stats:** 1 reply, 1 like, 25 views (Jan 20, 2026)

**Opportunity Type:** Tool Frustration - Question

**Current @build_os Reply (Jan 22):**

> "yeah I am not a fan of notion, what are you trying to organize/ build inside of it?"

**Status:** Awaiting response from @xoxoLove_Liyah. No follow-up needed unless she replies.

---

## Cross-Promotion Opportunity

**@djwayne3 Post Worth Engaging:** None this scan

@djwayne3's most recent post is from Dec 12, 2025 (Claude sycophancy meme). No fresh content for @build_os to cross-promote.

**Recommendation:** If DJ posts anything about BuildOS development, shipping features, or context engineering - that would be a good cross-promo opportunity.

---

## Posting Strategy

**Recommended Order:**

1. **@kulshows follow-up** - Already engaged weakly, opportunity to add real value
2. **@NoMoreWaitingVA** - Fresh AI memory frustration, good context engineering angle
3. **@devpinkisingh** - Thoughtful engagement on digital vs analog (no hard sell)

**Timing:** Space replies 30+ min apart
**Product Mentions:** Max 1-2 today - the @kulshows and @NoMoreWaitingVA posts are the best fits

**Skip:**

- @VilvaOfficial - AI/product account, may look competitive
- @xoxoLove_Liyah - Already engaged, awaiting response

---

## Voice Reminder for @build_os

### The Vibe

Edgy + relatable. The friend who tells you the truth about productivity.

### Core Moves

- **Drag tools, not people** - Notion is fair game, users aren't
- **Celebrate chaos** - ADHD brains aren't broken
- **Be honest** - About being beta, about limitations
- **Light swearing OK** - damn, hell, shit

### Quick Don'ts

- Corporate language ("We're excited to announce...")
- Lecturing or advice-giving
- Hard selling
- Being defensive

## Strategy Notes

### Observations

1. **@build_os engagement quality needs work** - The "agreed" reply to @kulshows is too minimal. Product accounts need to add value or show personality, not just validate.

2. **Notion frustration posts are common but often from template sellers** - Need to filter carefully for genuine users vs. people selling Notion courses.

3. **AI memory complaints are a strong angle** - The @NoMoreWaitingVA post shows real frustration with AI context loss. This is BuildOS's core value prop.

4. **ADHD Twitter is quiet** - Major ADHD accounts (@HowtoADHD, @danidonovan, @StructuredSucc) remain inactive. Opportunity gap continues.

5. **No fresh @djwayne3 content** - Last post Dec 12, 2025. No cross-promo opportunities for @build_os.

### Recommendations

1. **Follow up on @kulshows** - The "agreed" reply is weak. Add a second reply with actual insight or question.

2. **Engage @NoMoreWaitingVA** - Fresh AI memory frustration is perfect for BuildOS positioning.

3. **Consider @devpinkisingh for authentic engagement** - Don't sell, just have a real conversation about digital vs. analog.

4. **@djwayne3 needs to post** - @build_os has limited cross-promo opportunities without founder content.
