## 1. ADHD Founder (@adhd_founder) - 47 Notebooks Reality Check

**Post Link:** https://x.com/adhd_founder/status/2017991862104023549

**The Tweet:**

> Neurotypical productivity advice: 'Just write it down!'
>
> Me, with 47 notebooks, 12 apps, and Post-its on my monitor: 👁️👄👁️

**Stats:** 0 replies, 4 views (Feb 1, 2026 - 5h ago)

**Opportunity Type:** ADHD Struggle - PERFECT FIT

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
This is the exact pain point BuildOS solves. The "just write it down" advice fails because scattered minds don't need MORE places to write - they need ONE place that makes sense of the chaos. This account (17 followers, verified, "Started 1213 projects. Finished 4.") is a perfect peer-level engagement with high alignment to BuildOS audience.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Validate + Hot Take):**

> the "just write it down" advice was definitely written by someone who's never lost 47 notebooks
>
> the problem isn't writing it down. it's finding it again. and making sense of it. and knowing what to do next.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Solidarity + Soft Product):**

> this is exactly why we built buildos. not another place to write things - a place that actually makes sense of the chaos you already wrote down.
>
> (47 notebooks is relatable as hell btw)

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Pure Validation - No Sell):**

> the apps multiply because none of them actually work for how your brain works
>
> then you feel guilty for not using them "right"
>
> it's not you. it's the tools.

## 2. frizvi (@friizvii) - Notion Abandonment Story

**Post Link:** https://x.com/friizvii/status/2017674449747939524

**The Tweet:**

> built a Notion system 4 times. abandoned it every time.
>
> why? too much complexity from day 1.
>
> changed approach: built only the bare minimum first. added features as i actually needed them.
>
> system survived.
>
> lesson: baseline first. upgrades as you go.

**Stats:** 0 replies, 4 views (Jan 31, 2026)

**Opportunity Type:** Tool Frustration - Notion Abandonment

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
Classic Notion abandonment story. Interesting angle: this person is a "Digital Creator" who links to Notion in their bio, so they're giving advice to others while sharing their own struggle. The "baseline first" lesson aligns with BuildOS's simplicity approach.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Agree + Extend):**

> "too much complexity from day 1" - this is the whole problem with most productivity tools
>
> they give you infinite flexibility and then wonder why you spend 3 hours configuring instead of doing

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Validate + Question):**

> 4 times is actually impressive commitment tbh
>
> what made this last system different? genuinely curious - was it starting simpler, or something else?

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Soft Product Angle):**

> this is why we built buildos with basically no configuration
>
> dump your thoughts, AI figures out what matters, you do the thing. no databases, no templates, no setup paralysis.
>
> (shameless plug but your post is literally our origin story)

## 3. GenAI Level Up (@GenAI_Level_UP) - Context Engineering Era

**Post Link:** https://x.com/GenAI_Level_UP/status/2018074502438219886

**The Tweet:**

> Prompt engineering is dead.
>
> We're now in the era of Context Engineering. It's no longer about asking the right question; it's about building the right world for the AI to reason within.
>
> This is the biggest shift in generative AI since ChatGPT launched.
>
> New podcast episode

**Stats:** ~10 views (Feb 1, 2026 - 13m ago)

**Opportunity Type:** Context Engineering - DIRECT BUILDOS RELEVANCE

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
This is literally what BuildOS does - context engineering for personal productivity. The shift from "asking better questions" to "building better context" is the core BuildOS value proposition. This is a podcast account (333 followers), good for engagement.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Agree + Add Insight):**

> this shift is huge and most people don't realize it yet
>
> the best AI isn't about prompts. it's about the context you give it. and right now, most tools make you rebuild that context from scratch every session.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Connect to Personal Productivity):**

> applies to personal productivity too, not just coding
>
> AI is only as useful as the context it has about your life, projects, priorities. most people start every ChatGPT session from zero.
>
> context that compounds > prompts that repeat

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Soft Product - If Appropriate):**

> this is exactly what we're building with buildos - context engineering for your personal chaos
>
> dump your thoughts, AI has the full picture, every interaction builds on what came before
>
> no more "explain my project again" every session

## 4. ADHD Founder (@adhd_founder) - Permission Slip

**Post Link:** https://x.com/adhd_founder/status/2018036637402280366

**The Tweet:**

> Permission slip for ADHD founders this weekend:
>
> You're allowed to rest without earning it.
> You're allowed to cancel plans without guilt.
> You're allowed to do nothing without calling it lazy.
> You're allowed to sleep without finishing the to-do list.
> You're allowed to exist...

**Stats:** 2 views (Feb 1, 2026 - 2h ago)

**Opportunity Type:** ADHD Support - Community Building

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
This is a supportive post, not a pain point. Good for community building - shows @build_os cares about the ADHD community beyond just selling. No hard sell here, just support.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Pure Support):**

> needed this. saving this.
>
> the "earn rest" mindset is brutal.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Add to It):**

> adding one:
>
> you're allowed to have an unfinished project without being a failure
>
> hell, you're allowed to have 47 unfinished projects

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Skip - Already Engaged Above):**
_Consider skipping this if you already replied to their "47 notebooks" post. Don't want to seem like you're stalking one account._

## 5. Chaitanya Dhawan (@chaitanyad0208) - AI Memory Framework

**Post Link:** Search result - no direct link captured

**The Tweet:**

> All labs needs an open source framework for memory that works across all chatbots.
>
> I don't want to be logging in using Chatgpt to an app

**Stats:** 2 views (Feb 1, 2026 - fresh)

**Opportunity Type:** AI Memory Problem

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
Direct AI memory frustration. The "logging in using ChatGPT" comment shows frustration with fragmented AI context. BuildOS solves this.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Validate + Insight):**

> the fragmentation is real. every app, every AI, every session starts from zero
>
> we need context that follows you, not context locked in silos

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Soft Product):**

> this is exactly why we're building buildos differently - your context lives in one place, works across sessions, compounds over time
>
> AI with amnesia isn't that useful

## Cross-Promotion Opportunity

**@djwayne3 Post Worth Engaging:** None this scan

@djwayne3's most recent post is Dec 12, 2025. No fresh content for @build_os to cross-promote.

**Recommendation:** When DJ posts about BuildOS development or shipping features, @build_os should quote tweet or reply.

---

## Posting Strategy

**Recommended Order:**

1. **@adhd_founder "47 notebooks"** - Freshest, perfect fit, low competition, verified account
2. **@friizvii Notion abandonment** - Classic story, good engagement opportunity
3. **@GenAI_Level_UP context engineering** - Directly relevant, thought leadership space

**Timing:** Space replies 30+ min apart

**Product Mentions:** Max 2 today - recommend @adhd_founder (Option 2) and @GenAI_Level_UP (Option 3). Keep @friizvii engagement more conversational.

**Skip:**

- @adhd_founder "Permission slip" - Already engaging same account above
- @chaitanyad0208 - Good but lower priority than others

## Voice Reminder for @build_os

### The Vibe

Edgy + relatable. The friend who tells you the truth about productivity.

### Core Moves

- **Drag tools, not people** - Notion is fair game, users aren't
- **Celebrate chaos** - ADHD brains aren't broken
- **Be honest** - About being beta, about limitations
- **Light swearing OK** - damn, hell, shit

### Quick Don'ts

- Corporate language ("We're excited to announce...")
- Lecturing or advice-giving
- Hard selling
- Being defensive

## Strategy Notes

### Observations

1. **@adhd_founder is a goldmine** - Verified ADHD founder account, 17 followers, building in public, posting relatable content daily. Consider following and engaging regularly.

2. **Context engineering is trending** - The @GenAI_Level_UP post shows "context engineering" is becoming mainstream. Good timing for BuildOS positioning.

3. **Notion abandonment stories are common** - But many are from template sellers. @friizvii is genuine - they link to Notion but admit abandoning it 4 times.

4. **@djwayne3 needs to post** - No content since Dec 12, 2025. @build_os has limited cross-promo opportunities without founder activity.

5. **ADHD Twitter is more active today** - @adhd_founder is posting regularly (2 posts in 5 hours). Good sign for engagement opportunities.

### Recommendations

1. **Prioritize @adhd_founder engagement** - Perfect account alignment, low follower count means high visibility, posting frequently.

2. **Follow @adhd_founder from @build_os** - Build relationship, they're building "Dopamine ROI" which may have BuildOS alignment.

3. **Engage on context engineering posts** - This is BuildOS's core differentiator. Own this space.

4. **Consider original @build_os post** - Something like "the problem isn't productivity apps. it's that every productivity app makes you start from zero." would resonate.
