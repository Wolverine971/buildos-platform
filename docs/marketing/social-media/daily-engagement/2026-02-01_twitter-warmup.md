## 1. Boris Cherny (@bcherny) - Claude Code Tips Thread

**Post Link:** https://x.com/bcherny (thread from 22h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> I'm Boris and I created Claude Code. I wanted to quickly share a few tips for using Claude Code, sourced directly from the Claude Code team. The way the team uses Claude is different than how I use it. Remember: there is no one right way to use Claude Code -- everyone's setup is [different]...

**Stats:** 640 replies, 4.4K retweets, 36K likes, **4.2M views** (22h ago)

**Why This Tweet:**
This is THE viral moment. Boris, the Claude Code creator, sharing insider tips. This thread has massive visibility and Boris is actively engaged. DJ uses Claude Code daily for BuildOS - perfect opportunity to share real usage experience.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Value Mode - Real User Experience):**

> been building buildos entirely in claude code for months. the context it maintains across sessions is the game changer. not starting from scratch every conversation. skills system is brilliant - giving ai specific tools for the job instead of everything. thanks for building this.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Value Mode - Specific Insight):**

> the pattern i keep seeing: people focus on the model intelligence but the real differentiator is context management. claude code + opus 4.5 with maintained context beats raw intelligence that forgets. that's the moat.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Cheerleader Mode + Question):**

> this is incredible. using claude code daily and didn't know about half of these. curious - what's the most common mistake you see power users making?

## 2. Boris Cherny (@bcherny) - Asking for Feedback

**Post Link:** https://x.com/bcherny (end of thread, 22h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> Hope these tips are helpful! What do you want to hear about next?

**Stats:** 153 replies, 15 retweets, 1.2K likes, 166K views (22h ago)

**Why This Tweet:**
Boris is DIRECTLY asking for feedback. This is a golden opportunity to request content that aligns with BuildOS's thesis - context engineering, memory management, skills patterns.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Value Mode - Context Engineering):**

> would love a deep dive on context management strategies. how to structure CLAUDE.md files, when to use memory vs project context, how the team thinks about "what context does the agent need for this task?" that's the real skill.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Value Mode - Skills System):**

> how to build effective skills. the pattern of giving ai specific tools for specific jobs instead of everything - that's where the magic is. how does the team think about skill design?

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Cheerleader Mode + Request):**

> this thread was gold. would love to hear about workflows for maintaining context across long projects. how do you keep claude "in the loop" on a project that spans weeks?

## 3. Peter Steinberger (@steipete) - Claude Code vs Codex

**Post Link:** https://x.com/steipete (seen on timeline today)

**The Tweet:**

> I don't let Claude Code on my codebase. It's all codex. Would be too buggy with Opus.

**Stats:** 87 replies, 56 retweets, 945 likes, 62K views (today 2/1/26)

**Why This Tweet:**
Hot take comparing Claude Code vs OpenAI Codex. Peter is a well-known dev (OpenClaw community leader, 215K followers). This is a Claude vs OpenAI debate - perfect for DJ to share real experience using Claude Code.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Value Mode - Counter Experience):**

> interesting - i've had the opposite experience. building buildos entirely in claude code with opus 4.5. the difference is context management - i set up CLAUDE.md files so it knows the codebase patterns. without that context, yeah it would be chaotic. with it, it's precise.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Value Mode - Curious):**

> what specifically is causing the bugs? curious because i use claude code daily and it's been solid. wondering if it's a context issue or something else.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Cheerleader Mode + Genuine Question):**

> have you tried the skills system or custom CLAUDE.md setup? that changed everything for me. codex is fast but the context retention in claude code is what keeps me there.

## 4. Dex (@dexhorthy) - "It's Coming" / Agent Testing

**Post Link:** https://x.com/dexhorthy (Jan 30)

**The Tweet:**

> It's coming

(With huddle notification showing Kyle Mistele and Vaibhav Gupta in huddle for 41 minutes)

**Stats:** 0 replies, 0 retweets, 13 likes, 1.5K views (Jan 30)

**Why This Tweet:**
Dex coined "context engineering" - must maintain relationship. He's teasing something coming with his team. Low engagement = good opportunity to be seen.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Cheerleader Mode - Genuine Excitement):**

> very curious what you're cooking. 41 minutes of huddle = something substantial. hlyr.dev has been on my radar since your context engineering posts.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Value Mode - Engagement):**

> following your work on the post-IDE IDE closely. the context engineering angle is what everyone's going to realize matters more than the model itself.

## 5. Dex (@dexhorthy) - Agent Testing

**Post Link:** https://x.com/dexhorthy (Jan 30)

**The Tweet:**

> yep

(Quote tweeting @yoheinakajima: "from my convos (just fyi), nobody who is seriously building and stress testing agent capability is worried about the claw bots in moltbook... we saw similar reactions w autogpt/babyagi, smallville, project sid, truth terminal, etc. which are all significant but small steps towards...")

**Stats:** 1 reply, 0 retweets, 12 likes, 2.7K views (Jan 30)

**Why This Tweet:**
Dex agreeing that serious builders aren't worried about viral agent demos - they're focused on real capabilities. Perfect alignment with BuildOS's thesis about context > hype.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Value Mode - Agreement):**

> exactly. the viral demos are impressive but the actual work is in the boring stuff - context management, tool selection, maintaining state. that's what makes agents actually useful vs just entertaining.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Cheerleader Mode):**

> this is the take. everyone chasing viral agent moments but the real builders are focused on reliability and context.

## Voice Reminder

### The Philosophy

**Interesting guy + cheerleader. NOT a thought leader.**

### Two Modes

1. **Value Mode:** When you have experience to share - lead with insight, be specific, ask smart questions
2. **Cheerleader Mode:** When you don't - genuine hype, curious questions, celebrate their wins

### The 3 Rules (for Value Mode)

1. Can I visualize it? (specific details)
2. Can I falsify it? (real experience)
3. Can nobody else say this? (unique perspective)

### Quick Do's

- Genuine excitement when cheering someone on
- "hell yes" and specific praise for wins
- Curious questions about their journey
- Teammate energy - we're all rowing together

### Quick Don'ts

- "love this" or "great post" (hollow)
- Preachy setups ("Most people don't realize...")
- Generic observations anyone could make
- Teaching when you're just supporting
- Thought leader energy

## Strategy Recommendations

### Today's Observations

**1. Boris Cherny's Viral Moment = Golden Opportunity**

- 4.2M views on Claude Code tips thread
- Gained 26K followers in 2 days
- ACTIVELY asking "what do you want to hear about next?"
- This is the moment to establish relationship and request context-focused content

**2. Claude Code Momentum is Massive**

- Boris thread proving Claude Code is the tool of choice for builders
- Validates BuildOS's bet on Claude as primary LLM
- steipete's contrarian take creating debate - good engagement opportunity

**3. Context Engineering Validation**

- Dex's "yep" to Yohei about serious builders not chasing viral demos
- The narrative: context management > viral agent demos
- This is exactly BuildOS's thesis

**4. New Strategic Follow: Nina Lopatina (ContextualAI)**

- She followed DJ - relationship opportunity
- Works at company focused on context
- Small follower count but industry insider

### Recommendations

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Engage Boris's feedback request NOW** - Ask for context management content
2. **Reply to Boris's tips thread** - Share real BuildOS experience
3. **Join steipete Claude vs Codex debate** - Defend Claude Code with specifics
4. **Follow Nina Lopatina back** - Cultivate context engineering relationship

**Content Angles to Explore:**

1. **Context management workflows** - Boris is asking about this
2. **Claude Code success stories** - Real usage from building BuildOS
3. **Context > intelligence** - Keep reinforcing with Dex

### Strategy Update Needed?

[X] Minor tweak - Prioritize Boris engagement while thread is hot
[ ] Significant shift - Core strategy still working

**Reasoning:** Boris's viral moment + direct feedback request = rare opportunity. The 4.2M views mean any reply gets massive visibility. Priority shift to Claude Code team engagement for next 24-48h.
