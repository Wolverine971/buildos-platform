## 1. Boris Cherny (@bcherny) - Cowork Launch / Non-Coding Claude Code

**Post Link:** https://x.com/bcherny/status/2010809450844831752

**The Tweet:**

> Since we launched Claude Code, we saw people using it for all sorts of non-coding work: doing vacation research, building slide decks, cleaning up your email, cancelling subscriptions, recovering wedding photos from a hard drive, monitoring plant growth, controlling your oven.

**Stats:** HIGH engagement (Boris's posts have been getting millions of views since the Jan 31 viral thread)

**Why This Tweet:**
This is Boris introducing Cowork - the expansion of Claude Code beyond coding. This directly caused the $285B market selloff when the plugins dropped. Boris gained massive followers (234.8K → likely 250K+ now). Any reply gets enormous visibility. The context engineering angle here is PERFECT - Cowork is literally about giving AI the right context for non-coding work.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Value Mode - Context Engineering):**

> this is why context engineering matters beyond code. the same principle that makes CLAUDE.md files powerful for coding - giving ai the right context for the task - applies to everything.
>
> been building this exact thesis into buildos. ai that knows your projects and context beats generic ai every time, whether you're coding or planning your day.
>
> cowork is the proof.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Value Mode - Real Experience):**

> not surprised. been using claude code for non-coding work in buildos for months - project planning, organizing brain dumps, structuring ideas.
>
> the insight: the model is already smart enough. what matters is what context you give it. that's the unlock cowork is making accessible.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Cheerleader Mode + Question):**

> the fact that people naturally started using a coding tool for everything else tells you something important - the interface works, the model is ready, the only missing piece was context.
>
> curious how the plugin ecosystem evolves. any plans for a plugin marketplace beyond the official ones?

## 2. Boris Cherny (@bcherny) - Plugins Announcement

**Post Link:** https://x.com/bcherny/status/2009450715081789767

**The Tweet:**

> We just open sourced the code-simplifier agent we use on the Claude Code team. Try it: claude plugin install code-simplifier

**Related Context:** Boris also tweeted: "Super excited to release Plugins for Claude Code. Plugins are the easiest way to share and install bundles of agents, slash commands, MCP servers, and hooks. Something we saw people doing already, now we made it even easier."

**Why This Tweet:**
The plugins system is what caused the $285B market selloff. Boris described plugins as "the first major feature in Claude Code that I've gotten the opportunity to lead." The legal, sales, marketing, and data analysis plugins showed that Claude Code can replace entire SaaS categories. DJ uses Claude Code with custom skills/plugins daily - perfect engagement.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Value Mode - Plugin User):**

> been building custom skills for buildos in claude code for months. the plugin system formalizes what power users were already doing - bundling context, tools, and workflows together.
>
> the legal plugin causing a $285B stock selloff tells you everything about where this is heading. context-specific ai > generic saas.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Value Mode - Builder Perspective):**

> this is the pattern everyone's going to realize matters. it's not about the model being smart - it's about packaging the right context and tools for specific jobs.
>
> plugins = context engineering made distributable. that's huge.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Cheerleader Mode):**

> the fact that you open-sourced the code-simplifier your own team uses is exactly why the claude code community grows so fast. real tools from real usage.
>
> what's the most surprising plugin someone outside anthropic has built so far?

## 3. The "SaaS-pocalypse" - Cowork Market Reaction Thread

**Search Topic:** "Cowork plugins" OR "SaaS-pocalypse" OR "Anthropic stock selloff"

**Context:**
The Anthropic Cowork plugins announcement triggered a $285B selloff across software stocks. Thomson Reuters dropped 16%, LegalZoom 20%, Wolters Kluwer 13%. The market fear: AI is no longer just a productivity enhancer - it's a direct substitute for SaaS business models.

**Why This Topic:**
This is THE conversation in tech/AI right now. Everyone is debating whether AI agents will kill SaaS. DJ has a unique perspective as someone building an AI-native product (BuildOS) that IS the new paradigm, not the old one being disrupted. Perfect for establishing thought leadership without being preachy.

**Suggested Reply to anyone discussing the selloff - Option 1 (Value Mode):**

> been saying this. the companies at risk are the ones selling software features. the ones that win are selling context-specific outcomes.
>
> cowork plugins aren't just "ai in legal." they're ai that knows your contracts, your compliance rules, your workflows. that's the difference.
>
> context > features.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Value Mode - Builder Angle):**

> building buildos through this exact transition. the old model: sell users a tool and hope they figure out how to use it. the new model: give ai the right context and it does the work.
>
> the $285B selloff is the market realizing that context engineering isn't a buzzword - it's the new business model.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Cheerleader Mode + Nuance):**

> the panic is real but the nuance matters. most SaaS companies won't die overnight - they'll need to become context providers instead of feature providers.
>
> the ones who understand that their real moat is domain-specific context, not UI, will actually get stronger.

## 4. Dex (@dexhorthy) - Context Engineering Validated

**Post Link:** Check https://x.com/dexhorthy for latest posts

**Context:**
Dex coined "context engineering." The Cowork plugins selloff is the biggest real-world validation of the concept yet - the market is literally pricing in that context-specific AI beats generic software. Dex recently had a podcast appearance chatting about context engineering, AI reliability, and the future of agents.

**Why Engage:**
Maintain the critical relationship. The Cowork moment validates everything Dex has been saying. If he posts about it, be there. If he hasn't posted yet, this is still worth a standalone engagement on his recent content.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Value Mode - Validation):**

> the cowork plugins selloff is the biggest validation of your thesis yet. $285B wiped because the market realized context-specific ai beats generic software.
>
> "context engineering" isn't just about prompts anymore - it's the entire business model for the next generation of tools.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Value Mode - Connection):**

> watching the market panic over cowork plugins and all i can think is "everything is context engineering" - your post from months ago.
>
> the companies that survive are the ones that understand their real value is domain-specific context, not features.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Cheerleader Mode):**

> you called it. the cowork moment is context engineering going mainstream in the most dramatic way possible.
>
> what's your read on this? overreaction or is this the real inflection point?

## 5. Dan Shipper (@danshipper) - 2026 AI Predictions with Reid Hoffman

**Post Link:** https://x.com/danshipper/status/2008932049613189365

**The Tweet:**

> My 2026 AI predictions podcast with @reidhoffman—LinkedIn cofounder, Microsoft board member, and former OpenAI board member:
> Reid's spiciest predictions:
>
> - If you're not recording every single meeting and using agents to amplify your work process, it's going to feel like using a [typewriter]...

**Why This Tweet:**
Dan Shipper runs Every and built Proof (agent-native editor) - he's a competitor in the AI productivity space. Reid Hoffman is a massive name. Good visibility opportunity. Dan also tweeted about his 2026 programming workflow looking unrecognizable to his 2021 self.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Value Mode - Agreement + Nuance):**

> reid's take on agents amplifying work process is exactly right. the part nobody talks about though - agents need context to amplify effectively.
>
> recording meetings is step one. building persistent context about your projects, goals, and progress is the real unlock.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Cheerleader Mode + Question):**

> reid hoffman and dan shipper talking AI predictions? yeah i'm watching this.
>
> curious about reid's take on context management - does he think agents will each have their own context or will there be shared context layers?

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Value Mode - Builder):**

> the gap between "using ai" and "using ai with context" is massive.
>
> been building this at buildos - ai that remembers your projects across sessions. the agent isn't just doing tasks, it's building on everything you've discussed. that's what 2026 looks like.

## 6. Pieter Levels (@levelsio) - 2026 AI World Models

**Post Link:** https://x.com/levelsio/status/1968747296604004362

**The Tweet:**

> 2023 was the year of AI avatars
> 2024 was the year of AI photos
> 2025 was the year of AI videos
> And I think it's becoming clear now that 2026 will be the year of AI world models
> Fully interactive explorable 3d worlds generated from one or multiple 2d images or a prompt

**Stats:** HIGH engagement (Levels has 809K+ followers)

**Why This Tweet:**
Levels is the indie hacker GOAT. His prediction framework is clean and shareable. The world models take is interesting but the real engagement angle is the pattern: each year, AI gets closer to understanding and interacting with context, not just generating content.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (Value Mode - Pattern Extension):**

> the pattern underneath all of these: each year ai gets better at understanding and maintaining context.
>
> avatars = context of a face. photos = context of a scene. videos = context over time. world models = context in 3d space.
>
> the real breakthrough isn't the output. it's context that compounds.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (Cheerleader Mode):**

> this framework is clean. the progression from static generation to interactive worlds tracks perfectly.
>
> what are you building with world models? feels like interiorai.com would be insane with explorable 3d rooms.

**Suggested Reply Option 3 (Value Mode - Practical):**

> love this prediction. been thinking about how this applies to productivity too - ai that can "explore" your project context in 3d, seeing connections between ideas visually.
>
> 2026 might also be the year ai stops having amnesia. context that persists > intelligence that resets.

## 7. Topic Search: ADHD + AI Productivity

**Search Queries:**

- `ADHD productivity AI -is:retweet lang:en since:2026-02-03`
- `"brain dump" tasks -is:retweet lang:en since:2026-02-03`
- `ChatGPT "forgot" context -is:retweet lang:en since:2026-02-03`

**Context:**
Major ADHD accounts remain quiet but smaller creators continue posting. New AI ADHD tools appearing (Saner.AI, Goblin Tools gaining traction). The Cowork announcement is particularly relevant to ADHD users - non-coding ai that can organize your life.

**Why Search:**
ADHD community is BuildOS's core audience. Wednesday is "AI Context Problems" day per the search rotation schedule. The Cowork moment gives a fresh angle - "AI that knows your context isn't just for coders anymore."

**Suggested Generic Reply Template for ADHD + AI posts:**

> the biggest struggle isn't finding the right todo app. it's that every tool expects you to organize yourself first before it can help.
>
> what if ai just knew your context? your projects, your goals, what you've already talked about? that's the real unlock for scattered minds.
>
> been building this exact thing. curious what's working for you?

---

## Posting Strategy

**Recommended Order:**

1. **Boris Cowork post** - Highest visibility, most relevant to BuildOS thesis. The $285B selloff makes anything Claude Code adjacent get massive reach.
2. **SaaS-pocalypse discussion** - Find the hottest thread about the stock selloff and add the context engineering angle. This is today's zeitgeist.
3. **Boris plugins post** - Second touchpoint with Boris, but space it 1+ hour from first.
4. **Dex** - Check for fresh posts about Cowork/context engineering validation. If nothing fresh, engage on his recent podcast appearance.
5. **Dan Shipper** - Lower priority but good for competitor visibility.
6. **ADHD search results** - End of day, different audience segment.
7. **Levelsio** - Only if post is fresh enough to get visibility.

**Timing:** Start now - the Cowork/selloff conversation is RED HOT and every hour it cools
**Spacing:** 30+ min between replies. Prioritize the first 3.

## New Accounts Discovered

### Watch for accounts discussing the SaaS-pocalypse

The $285B selloff is creating a whole new set of voices in the AI-replaces-SaaS conversation. Watch for:

- Tech analysts discussing Cowork's implications
- SaaS founders reacting (fear or opportunity)
- Context engineering practitioners gaining visibility
- Legal tech commentators

**Action:** During manual scan, note any accounts with 1K-100K followers making sharp observations about Cowork/context engineering.

---

## Competitor Intelligence

### @bcherny (Boris Cherny) - Claude Code Creator - CRITICAL

**Followers:** Likely 250K+ (was 234.8K on Feb 3, growing ~5K/day)
**Activity:** Cowork launch, plugins announcement, open-sourced code-simplifier
**Implications:** Claude Code is now officially a platform, not just a dev tool. Cowork + plugins = Claude Code for everyone. This validates BuildOS's entire approach of AI-first with context.
**Action:** ENGAGE on Cowork and plugins posts. This is the most important engagement opportunity in weeks.

### @dannypostma (PostmaOS) - DIRECT COMPETITOR

**Status:** Not scanned since Jan 24. Was on mental health break.
**Action:** Check if he's back and reacting to the Cowork news. If PostmaOS was building SaaS-style, the Cowork plugins might threaten his model too.

### @danidonovan (Anti-Planner) - ADHD COMPETITOR

**Status:** Quiet since December 2025
**Action:** Monitor for return. The AI + ADHD space is heating up with Saner.AI, Goblin Tools.

### @dexhorthy (Context Engineering) - OWN THIS SPACE

**Followers:** ~11.6K
**Activity:** Podcast about context engineering, AI reliability, future of agents
**Implications:** The Cowork selloff is the biggest validation of context engineering as a concept. Dex should be celebrating.
**Action:** Engage on any Cowork reaction posts. Connect the dots between his thesis and the market validation.

### Anthropic - MACRO TREND

**Activity:** Cowork plugins triggered $285B stock selloff. Legal plugin caused Thomson Reuters -16%, LegalZoom -20%. Media calling it "SaaS-pocalypse."
**Implications:** This is the most significant validation of AI replacing traditional software since ChatGPT launch. BuildOS is on the RIGHT side of this - we're AI-native, not SaaS being disrupted.
**Action:** Position BuildOS and DJ as understanding why this is happening (context engineering) rather than just reacting to the panic.

### YC Spring 2026 RFS

**Activity:** Dropped recently. AI-native companies as the thesis. "AI-powered agencies" model highlighted.
**Implications:** YC is telling founders to build AI-native. BuildOS IS AI-native. Validation.
**Action:** Consider content about being AI-native from day one.

## Voice Reminder

### The Philosophy

**Interesting guy + cheerleader. NOT a thought leader.**

### Two Modes

1. **Value Mode:** When you have experience to share - lead with insight, be specific, ask smart questions
2. **Cheerleader Mode:** When you don't - genuine hype, curious questions, celebrate their wins

### The 3 Rules (for Value Mode)

1. Can I visualize it? (specific details)
2. Can I falsify it? (real experience)
3. Can nobody else say this? (unique perspective)

### Quick Do's

- Genuine excitement when cheering someone on
- "hell yes" and specific praise for wins
- Curious questions about their journey
- Teammate energy - we're all rowing together

### Quick Don'ts

- "love this" or "great post" (hollow)
- Preachy setups ("Most people don't realize...")
- Generic observations anyone could make
- Teaching when you're just supporting
- Thought leader energy

## Strategy Recommendations

### Today's Observations

1. **The Cowork plugins selloff is the BIGGEST story in tech right now.** $285B wiped from software stocks. This validates BuildOS's thesis that context-specific AI beats generic SaaS. Every conversation is about this.

2. **Boris Cherny continues to be the #1 engagement target.** His posts get millions of views. Cowork and plugins are his babies. Engaging here gets maximum visibility.

3. **Context engineering is no longer a niche concept.** The market selloff happened because investors realized context-specific AI can replace entire SaaS categories. Dex's thesis just went mainstream in the most dramatic way possible.

4. **YC Spring 2026 RFS validates AI-native thesis.** YC is telling founders to build AI-native from day one. BuildOS has been doing this since May 2025.

5. **Dan Shipper/Reid Hoffman podcast** shows the "agents amplifying work" narrative is reaching mainstream business audiences.

### Recommendations

1. **URGENT: Engage Boris on Cowork/plugins NOW.** The conversation is hot. Every hour it cools.
2. **Find and engage the best "SaaS-pocalypse" threads.** Add the context engineering angle - this is why it's happening.
3. **Connect with Dex on the validation.** His concept just caused a $285B market event.
4. **Consider a standalone post/thread** about why BuildOS is AI-native and how context engineering is the new business model.
5. **Monitor Danny Postma** - if PostmaOS is SaaS-style, the Cowork news might change his approach.

### Strategy Update Needed?

[ ] No changes - current strategy is working
[X] Minor tweak - Cowork/plugins selloff creates urgent engagement window. Priority shift to Claude Code ecosystem + SaaS disruption narrative for next 48-72h.
[ ] Significant shift

**Update the strategy log:** `docs/marketing/social-media/twitter-strategy-recommendations-log.md`
