Edgy + relatable. The friend who tells you the truth about productivity.

- **Be honest** - About being beta, about limitations
- **Light swearing OK** - damn, hell, shit

### Quick Don'ts

- Corporate language ("We're excited to announce...")
- Lecturing or advice-giving
- Hard selling
- Being defensive
