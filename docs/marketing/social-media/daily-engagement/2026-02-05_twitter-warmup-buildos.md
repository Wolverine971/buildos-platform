## 1. Simon Hoiberg - Notion Lock-In & Alternatives

**Post Link:** https://x.com/SimonHoiberg/status/2019395074849739233

**The Tweet:**

> Last year, I tried replacing Notion with Docmost and Plane. But I have to admit it... I came crawling back. Notion is too good! And the sad reality is - in most cases, self-hostable alternatives just can't really compete with these well-funded, profitable, commercial products. But these products still shouldn't own us! So I'm proposing a solution that allows us to KEEP using them without being locked in. Who is gonna build this?

**Stats:** 13 replies, 18 likes, 965 views (5h)

**Opportunity Type:** Tool Discussion / Indie Hacker

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
Simon (154K followers) is a bootstrapped SaaS builder (FeedHive, AidBase, etc.) in our tracker. His post is about the tension between powerful tools and ownership. @build_os angle: the real problem isn't lock-in, it's that tools like Notion require you to organize for the tool, not for yourself.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (anti-complexity angle):**

> the lock-in problem is real but there's a deeper one nobody talks about
>
> you can export your Notion data anytime. but can you export back the 40 hours you spent configuring it?
>
> the real question isn't "who owns your data" it's "does the tool actually match how your brain works"

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (celebration + honest take):**

> respect the honesty. most people pretend they're still using the alternative.
>
> notion is genuinely great if your brain thinks in databases. for the rest of us it's a beautiful graveyard of abandoned workspaces.

## 2. Seana Scott - Manual Brain Dump Workflow

**Post Link:** Search: from:Seana*Scott* "brain dump" (Feb 2, 2026)

**The Tweet:**

> How to go from overwhelmed to ordered:
>
> 1. Brain dump. Write down all the things swirling in my mind that need attending to.
> 2. Divide the list by tasks, projects, and routines.
> 3. Calendar everything.
>    When everything has a time and a place, the brain can rest.

**Stats:** Low engagement, Feb 2 (3 days old)

**Opportunity Type:** Brain Dump / Product Mention Natural Fit

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
This IS the BuildOS workflow described manually. Step 1 = brain dump. Step 2 = AI extraction. Step 3 = scheduling. Perfect opportunity for a soft product mention where it genuinely fits.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (validate + soft product mention):**

> this is literally the whole thing.
>
> step 1 is the only part most people actually do. steps 2 and 3 are where everyone gets stuck.
>
> (shameless plug: we built BuildOS to automate steps 2 and 3. you dump, AI organizes. still beta but this tweet is basically our product spec)

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (validate only, no sell):**

> the brain dump is the key and most productivity advice skips it entirely.
>
> "just make a list" assumes you already know what's on the list. the dump is what gets it out of your head so you can actually see it.

## 3. DeeDee - ADHD Helper - ADHD Without the Productivity Filter

**Post Link:** Search: from:DopaminePlsMe "productivity" (Feb 5, 2026, ~4h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> What ADHD looks like without the productivity-filter: meds whiplash, burnout, and the weird grace of accepting how your brain works. @ashmikbailey17 wrote it raw and honest:
> [link to blog post: "The Real ADHD Conversation: An Unfiltered Story of Medication, Burnout & Ac..."]

**Stats:** 1 reply, 1 repost, 25 likes, 1.6K views (4h)

**Opportunity Type:** ADHD Validation

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
This is the anti-productivity-porn ADHD content that @build_os voice is built for. No fixing, just seeing. The "accepting how your brain works" framing is exactly the @build_os philosophy.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (pure validation, no sell):**

> "the weird grace of accepting how your brain works"
>
> this. the productivity world wants to fix ADHD brains. the actual answer is building around them, not against them.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (slightly edgier):**

> every productivity tool is designed for the neurotypical brain and then they add an "ADHD mode" as an afterthought.
>
> the real conversation starts with accepting that scattered isn't broken. it's just non-linear.

## 4. ejae dev - Context Engineering & Context Surviving Sessions

**Post Link:** Search: from:ejae_dev "context engineering" (Feb 5, 2026, ~6m ago)

**The Tweet:**

> evening thought on context engineering:
> the gap between someone who "uses claude code" and someone who gets 10x results from it is how much context survives between sessions.
> /insights reads your message history. CLAUDE.md persists project rules. skills files...

**Stats:** 10 views (6 min old - VERY fresh)

**Opportunity Type:** AI Context / Trending Topic

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
Claude Code /insights is trending hard right now (2,370+ posts). ejae's post is about context surviving between sessions - which is the core BuildOS thesis (context that compounds). This is more of a @djwayne3 topic but @build_os could angle it toward the user/productivity side.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (product voice on context):**

> this is the whole game. not just for code but for life.
>
> most productivity tools give you a blank page every time you open them. zero memory. zero context.
>
> we're building BuildOS around the idea that your AI should remember what you told it last week.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (lighter touch):**

> "how much context survives between sessions"
>
> applies to every AI tool, not just code. chatgpt forgets you exist between conversations. that's the real bottleneck.

## 5. ScatterCloud\_ - ADHD & Traditional Productivity Tools Failing

**Post Link:** Search: from:ScatterCloud\_ "productivity" (Feb 5, 2026, ~12h ago)

**The Tweet:**

> It also functions more easily and helps build healthy habits and lifestyle changes without the pressure of "perfect productivity". This is especially helpful for those who struggle with traditional productivity tools, like me with ADHD. It allows them to become a better version

**Stats:** 0 replies, 0 likes, 27 views (12h)

**Opportunity Type:** ADHD / Tool Frustration

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
The handle name alone (ScatterCloud) is on-brand. They're talking about ADHD and traditional productivity tools failing. Low engagement = less competition for replies. Good community building opportunity.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (validate + relate):**

> "without the pressure of perfect productivity" - this is the whole thing.
>
> ADHD brains don't need perfect systems. they need systems that work when you're scattered, not just when you're having a good focus day.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (edgier):**

> traditional productivity tools are built for people who can already organize. if you could already organize, you wouldn't need the tool.
>
> that's the whole scam.

## 6. Shannon Kempenich - Brain Dump Feature in ClosedCal (Competitor)

**Post Link:** Search: from:TheLifeHiker "brain dump" (Feb 2, 2026)

**The Tweet:**

> If you are overwhelmed you should try the "Brain Dump" feature I built into ClosedCal. It lets you "Dump" everything in and organizes it into projects / tasks / events, etc... so you can get out of your head and on with your life. ... try it, let me know what you think.

**Stats:** 0 replies, 0 likes, 7 views (3 days old)

**Opportunity Type:** Competitor / Brain Dump

**Why This Works for @build_os:**
Direct competitor with "brain dump" feature. Low traction. Engage respectfully - celebrate the approach, don't attack. Shows market validation for the brain dump concept.

**Suggested Reply Option 1 (respectful + community):**

> love seeing more tools embrace the brain dump approach. the "just dump everything out" workflow is so underrated.
>
> we're building something similar with BuildOS - AI that takes the dump and figures out what's actually a task vs. a thought vs. a project. different angle, same philosophy.

**Suggested Reply Option 2 (lighter - just support):**

> the brain dump → auto-organize flow is the future. way more natural than starting with a blank to-do list.
>
> cool to see this built into a calendar tool.

## Cross-Promotion Opportunity

**@djwayne3 Post Worth Engaging:** None this scan - @djwayne3 last posted Dec 12, 2025.

**Recommended Action:** @djwayne3 should post something soon. The Claude Code /insights trend is HOT right now (2,370+ posts) and would be a natural topic for DJ to post about, which @build_os could then quote-tweet.

---

## Posting Strategy

**Recommended Order:**

1. **@DopaminePlsMe** (4h, ADHD validation - freshest, no product mention needed)
2. **@SimonHoiberg** (5h, Notion discussion - high visibility, 154K followers)
3. **@ejae_dev** (6min, context engineering - ride the trending wave)
4. **@Seana*Scott*** (3d, brain dump - natural product mention opportunity)
5. **@ScatterCloud\_** (12h, ADHD tool frustration - community building)
6. **@TheLifeHiker** (3d, competitor - optional, engage if time permits)

**Timing:** Space replies 30+ min apart
**Product Mentions:** 2 today max - #3 (ejae*dev) and #4 (Seana_Scott*) are the most natural fits. Rest should be pure validation/community.

## Voice Reminder for @build_os

### The Vibe

Edgy + relatable. The friend who tells you the truth about productivity.

### Core Moves

- **Drag tools, not people** - Notion is fair game, users aren't
- **Celebrate chaos** - ADHD brains aren't broken
- **Be honest** - About being beta, about limitations
- **Light swearing OK** - damn, hell, shit

### Quick Don'ts

- Corporate language ("We're excited to announce...")
- Lecturing or advice-giving
- Hard selling
- Being defensive

## Strategy Notes

**Trending Opportunity:** Claude Code /insights is MASSIVE right now (2,370+ posts, 19h old). This is primarily a @djwayne3 topic, but @build_os could engage on the "context surviving between sessions" angle since that's the BuildOS thesis. Recommend DJ posts about this ASAP so @build_os can cross-promote.

**Brain Dump Market Validation:** Two separate people (Shannon Kempenich building it into ClosedCal, Seana Scott describing the manual workflow) are talking about brain dump independently. This confirms market demand for the brain dump approach.

**ADHD Content Performing Well:** DeeDee's post about ADHD without the productivity filter got 25 likes and 1.6K views in 4h - the anti-productivity-porn angle resonates.

**Observation:** "Notion frustration" searches today yielded more positive Notion content than frustration. The Simon Hoiberg post is interesting because it's a nuanced take - he loves Notion but worries about lock-in. Good for a thoughtful @build_os response rather than just "Notion bad."
