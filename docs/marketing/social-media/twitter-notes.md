# Tweeting strat for educational content.

## How to begin

ok when I begin a tweet I want to always begin with a moment in time of where I am at and what i have been doing so that it sucks the reader into the moment.

I want to build common ground with the reader. and then label an emotion that I was feeling or that I think was being felt by others. That will help get people to open up. Then i go into what ever I am intersted in.

## The meat of the tweet

Then I want to go into what I have learned. Based off of that and go into the detailed specifics in a listicle type form
