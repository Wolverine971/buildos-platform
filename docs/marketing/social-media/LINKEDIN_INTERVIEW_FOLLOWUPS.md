## Questions

### 1. Hackathons (Builder Credibility)

You mentioned winning a few hackathons. This is great content - shows you can ship fast under pressure.

**Questions:**

- Which hackathons did you win?
- What did you build at each one?
- Any memorable moments from those experiences?
- How long ago was this?

**How I'll use this:**

- "Here's what I learned building X in 48 hours" posts
- Establishes you as someone who can actually build, not just talk
- Shows pattern of shipping fast (connects to BuildOS story)

---

### 2. Y Combinator Story (Optional - Only If Comfortable)

You said you were "close to it" and feel "backstabbed" for not getting in.

**Questions:**

- Did you apply with BuildOS or a different project?
- How far did you get in the process?
- What feedback did you get (if any)?
- How did it feel? How do you think about it now?

**How I'll use this:**

- Rejection stories perform well on LinkedIn (relatable)
- "I didn't get into YC. Here's what I'm doing instead." angle
- Shows resilience, not bitterness
- Only use if you're comfortable - can skip entirely

### 3. Funny/Relatable Founder Moments

You said "IDK" but these moments are content gold. They humanize you and get high engagement.

**Think about:**

- Ever ship something broken to users?
- Have a feature idea at 2am that seemed genius... and wasn't?
- Try to explain BuildOS to someone and they just didn't get it at all?
- Build something you were proud of that no one cared about?
- Any "why did I think that was a good idea?" moments?
- Coding for 8 hours only to realize you were solving the wrong problem?
- Any funny user feedback or bug reports?

**How I'll use this:**

- "Founder life" posts that show the reality
- Self-deprecating humor builds trust
- Makes you relatable vs polished "thought leader" types you hate

---

### 4. "Blue Collar Software Engineering" (Your Brand)

This phrase jumped out at me. It's a unique positioning.

**Questions:**

- What does "blue collar software engineering" mean to you?
- How is this different from how other engineers/founders operate?
- Where did this mindset come from? (Marines? Bootcamp? Curri?)
- Any examples of this in action?

**How I'll use this:**

- This could become a core part of your LinkedIn identity
- Differentiates you from the "academic" AI crowd you mentioned
- Connects your military background → coding bootcamp → building
- "I'm not the smartest engineer. I'm the one who ships." type content

---

### 5. The User Feature Request Story

The user who wanted "I want to work on X project, clear my schedule, focus on that, tell me what to work on."

**Questions:**

- How did this conversation happen? (DM, call, feedback form?)
- Did you build this feature?
- Are you still in touch with them?
- What else did they say about their problems?

**How I'll use this:**

- Shows you listen to users
- Product development storytelling
- "A user asked for X. Here's what I learned building it." content

---

## After You Answer

1. Reply with your answers (in this doc or separately)
2. I'll update `LINKEDIN_FOUNDER_CONTEXT.md` with the new info
3. I'll revise the example posts in `LINKEDIN_STRATEGY.md` to use your real stories
4. We'll have enough material to draft your first real LinkedIn posts

---

## Priority

If you only have time for a few:

1. **Hackathons** - Quick wins, easy to answer
2. **Blue Collar Engineering** - Defines your brand
3. **Funny Moments** - High engagement content

The YC and User stories are bonus if you have time.
