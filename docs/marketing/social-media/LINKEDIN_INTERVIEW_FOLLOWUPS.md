## Questions

### 1. Hackathons (Builder Credibility)

You mentioned winning a few hackathons. This is great content - shows you can ship fast under pressure.

**Questions:**

- Which hackathons did you win?
- What did you build at each one?
- Any memorable moments from those experiences?
- How long ago was this?

So, I participated in a few hackathons run by Fallin, it's at fallin.today, and it was hackathons that are primarily based for military dudes, or veterans, and it was run by a friend of mine who runs Fallin, and he also went to Sabio with me, the Sabio coding bootcamp. Each time, I built like a data ingestion thing, where you ingest data and show it on a map, so one was like showing all a bunch of veteran resources on a map, using Mapbox and stuff like that, React, and different things, yeah it was just a good learning experience, I first got exposed to React in one of those, and I got exposed to SvelteKit in one of those. These were a few years ago, well yeah, it was like classic hackathon stuff, we didn't pull an all-nighter, but stayed up late grinding, and it was great. But yeah there was like judges and multiple teams and i think two or three times. Actually my team one it.

**How I'll use this:**

- "Here's what I learned building X in 48 hours" posts
- Establishes you as someone who can actually build, not just talk
- Shows pattern of shipping fast (connects to BuildOS story)

---

### 2. Y Combinator Story (Optional - Only If Comfortable)

You said you were "close to it" and feel "backstabbed" for not getting in.

**Questions:**

- Did you apply with BuildOS or a different project?
- How far did you get in the process?
- What feedback did you get (if any)?
- How did it feel? How do you think about it now?

Okay, so for Y Combinator, I applied with Nine Takes, uh, I think twice, and then I applied with BuildOS once. Um, I didn't get an interview or anything. There was no feedback. Um, it's kind of rough. I thought I might have a chance of getting in with BuildOS because, um, I put in effort on the video, and I thought I had a good strategy, and they're investing, or they're really interested in AI stuff, but, uh, like AI B2C companies, and, um, I just didn't crack the code. I think I don't have the best credentials, and it's kind of like I'm more of a wildcard. Um, and I don't think my idea sounded new enough. I think it's gonna be, or not new enough, but I mean, maybe my idea for BuildOS wasn't differentiated enough. I didn't explain it well enough. That's kind of what I'm thinking about, but, um, and a reason I feel backstabbed is, I don't feel backstabbed. It's just my previous company, Curri, those founders were based out of Y Combinator, and I feel like I'm almost on their level. Like, they had no idea what they were getting into when they started Curri, but I have a way better idea. Um, but maybe that's not, that's not the factor that matters. I think they may, at the time they applied, they were more, the idea for Curri was more new versus my idea wasn't as new or differentiated. Um, but the other thing is my friend got into Y Combinator who worked at Curri and I was like, I was, I'm like just as good of a programmer as him, as I think I am at least, but um, I don't know. It's just, it's mixed emotions for me when I think about Y Combinator.

**How I'll use this:**

- Rejection stories perform well on LinkedIn (relatable)
- "I didn't get into YC. Here's what I'm doing instead." angle
- Shows resilience, not bitterness
- Only use if you're comfortable - can skip entirely

### 3. Funny/Relatable Founder Moments

You said "IDK" but these moments are content gold. They humanize you and get high engagement.

**Think about:**

- Ever ship something broken to users?
- Have a feature idea at 2am that seemed genius... and wasn't?
- Try to explain BuildOS to someone and they just didn't get it at all?
- Build something you were proud of that no one cared about?
- Any "why did I think that was a good idea?" moments?
- Coding for 8 hours only to realize you were solving the wrong problem?
- Any funny user feedback or bug reports?

Okay, so for the funny, relatable moments, have I ever shipped something broken to users? Yes, all the time. I feel like I ship it and I'll figure out in prod. I mean, not exactly. I do test it and make sure things, but I have a lot of logging built in, so I get proactively pinged when things are broken and stuff like that. But the reason I do that is because I don't really have any daily active users. So I'm like, I'd rather just keep pushing things forward, fix things as they come up. Yeah, I constantly have feature ideas and it's a big struggle. It's an ongoing process for me to stay focused on the things that actually matter. Yeah, like one feature I have is Project War Room, where it's kind of a war game scenario. And you take your project when it's ready to the war room and it walks you through a bunch of different scenarios. It's a good idea, but like, I think right now it's more important to just get the basic functionality of you organizing your project, organizing your thoughts, and having AI know about your project and be able to help you with your project. That's more of the important task right now. The other stuff with like a war game thing is more like a phase two later down the road. So it's like, for me, it's like staying similarly focused on what's important right now. Yeah, sometimes when I experience BuildOS, I'm just out of enthusiasm where I'm just like, yeah, it's an AI project where you just like talk to it and it organizes information for you. And people are like, well, how is that different from chatgpt? And then I say, well, here you have projects that you can keep coming back to and the AI can like help you in your projects. And like, it's like a bucket for information. So like anytime you have an ongoing project that you're going to be working on for a while, you can just keep storing information in BuildOS and you can talk to it. It's kind of like a thought partner on your project and it knows about your project. But all that is kind of noise. It's not explained succinctly sometimes. Yeah, I think in earlier versions of BuildOS, I used AI a lot for it, like Claude and Codex and stuff like that. But like in the beginning, I was not paying for the maximum capabilities of it. And I think I wasted time because AI was so powerful and it continues to get more and more powerful. But I think paying for the better versions helps me accelerate my growth, stuff like that. But I don't have any daily active users. So that's just really frustrating. And like with my wife, I try to get her to use BuildOS, but she'll like discover a bug. And so that's always like demoralizing because I'm like, no, I'm so excited to tell you this or show you this thing, but she can't get past certain parts. So that's kind of been frustrating, but it's also just nice to know that I'm catching things before real users catch things.

**How I'll use this:**

- "Founder life" posts that show the reality
- Self-deprecating humor builds trust
- Makes you relatable vs polished "thought leader" types you hate

---

### 4. "Blue Collar Software Engineering" (Your Brand)

This phrase jumped out at me. It's a unique positioning.

**Questions:**

- What does "blue collar software engineering" mean to you?
- How is this different from how other engineers/founders operate?
- Where did this mindset come from? (Marines? Bootcamp? Curri?)
- Any examples of this in action?

For blue-collar software engineering, I just differentiate that between, like, people ask me, oh, you must be so smart for being a software engineer. It's like, okay, I know some things, but, like, more it's just, like, diving deeply into the nitty-gritty of a bunch of things. And I don't think I'm a genius. And I actually get annoyed by programmers who try to intellectualize code, because I'm just like, you're not building. You don't build that much. You just sit around and talk about things. Like, I haven't met that many good programmers who intellectualize coding. Like, most of the good programmers I know are the kind of people who have learned through experience and, like, just know stuff through trial and error. The people who are, like, really, like, brainy about it, I feel like they're not good programmers, and they don't even push a lot of code. They don't ship a lot. They just debate about code a lot. And it makes me not really respect them and stuff. But, yeah, like, a lot of the people that yeah, there's one engineer in particular, Sean. I really love working with this guy. And he is very smart and stuff. But it was, like, it was all smart coding practices and things that he did architecturally that were earned through trial and error and through just years of experience. And he didn't look down on me, or he was always so approachable, and he explained things really in a nice way. So, that's what I mean by blue collar. It's like a tinkering. I think of it as a mechanic. Like, a mechanic works on cars for the fun of it. I work on code for the fun of it and just build things for the fun of it. And it's more about obsessing about it. Like, I think car mechanics, like old car enthusiasts who, like, work on cars and refurbish cars, they just love getting in the garage and doing that. Me, I just love sitting down at my computer and really working on an idea and building it and hashing it out and, like, connecting things and making it all work together and, like, wowing someone with the end result. That's kind of the stuff I like.

**How I'll use this:**

- This could become a core part of your LinkedIn identity
- Differentiates you from the "academic" AI crowd you mentioned
- Connects your military background → coding bootcamp → building
- "I'm not the smartest engineer. I'm the one who ships." type content

### 5. The User Feature Request Story

The user who wanted "I want to work on X project, clear my schedule, focus on that, tell me what to work on."

For the user who wanted to work on Project X Clear Schedule, they saw BuildLS, and they were like, this is cool, I want to work on it. And I think he had also done startups, so he was just kind of wanting to meet the team and see where we're at. It was just like, he liked the idea of BuildLS and having organized chaotic thoughts, and he just kind of wanted to see where we were at. And yeah, we did a Zoom meeting with him, and we just talked to them about stuff. We didn't fully build the feature for him, because this was a while back where we weren't even set up with an agentic chat. I had built a bunch of other things for manually, programmatically clearing a schedule, and rescheduling things. But now I have it to where the agent can do what the user tells it to in that way. I do want to reach out to him. The other thing is, I ran into a user who was like, in a separate interview, it was a friend, he basically said, just make me more productive. Look at my schedule and just tell me what to do. Look at my priorities and tell me what to do. And that is another piece of feedback that's come up another time, where it's like, people just want, people just feel like they're not being as productive as they could be, and they just want to be more productive. So anything to help them be more productive, I think people are desperate for.

**Questions:**

- How did this conversation happen? (DM, call, feedback form?)
- Did you build this feature?
- Are you still in touch with them?
- What else did they say about their problems?

**How I'll use this:**

- Shows you listen to users
- Product development storytelling
- "A user asked for X. Here's what I learned building it." content
