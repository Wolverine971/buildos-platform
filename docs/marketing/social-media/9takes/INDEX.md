## Engagement Strategy for 9takes Outreach

### Why These Accounts Care About 9takes

1. **Perspective-Taking** - 9takes' core feature (see how 9 types respond) aligns with their interest in understanding others
2. **Self-Discovery** - Most followers seek deeper self-understanding
3. **Breaking Echo Chambers** - Aligns with psychological research on empathy and perspective
4. **Enneagram Community** - Direct overlap with existing Enneagram enthusiasts

### Engagement Templates

**For Enneagram teachers:**

```
This is exactly what the Enneagram community needs - a way to see real examples of how each type thinks, not just theory. Have you seen 9takes.com?
```

**For psychology/self-awareness accounts:**

```
Interesting perspective. The give-first model (share your view before seeing others) seems like a great way to develop genuine perspective-taking vs just consuming opinions.
```

**For personal development coaches:**

```
The idea of escaping filter bubbles by seeing how 9 different personality types answer the same question is fascinating for self-awareness work.
```

## Notes

- **Follower counts** are estimates from January 2026 research
