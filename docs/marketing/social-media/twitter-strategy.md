## Profile Setup

### Pinned Tweet

"I tried Notion 6 times. Abandoned it 6 times.

Built BuildOS because disorganized minds need different tools.

Just talk. AI organizes. You execute.

It's that simple.

## Content Pillars & Examples

### 1. Reality Checks (25%)

**Purpose:** Challenge productivity myths, validate struggles

**Tweet Examples:**

"Your Notion workspace is abandoned because you're not lazy.

You're overwhelmed.

Complex tools make scattered minds more scattered.

You need simplicity, not more features."

---

"Hot take: AI agents won't save your productivity.

You still need to decide what matters.
You still need to take action.
You still need to think.

AI should organize, not replace."

---

"That productivity guru's morning routine?

- 5am wake up
- 2 hour deep work
- Perfect time blocking

Your ADHD brain: 'lol no'

Build systems for your brain, not theirs."

### 2. Building in Public (25%)

**Purpose:** Transparency, relatability, trust-building

**Tweet Examples:**

"Today's ADHD moment:

Spent 2 hours building a feature.
Realized I built it last week.
Found 3 better ideas while looking for the old code.

This is why BuildOS has a 'what did I already do?' feature 😅"

---

"User feedback: 'Can you make it yell at me to focus?'

Me: No, but what if it just... showed you the next tiny step?

Them: 'Oh. Yeah. That's better.'

Gentle momentum > harsh motivation"

---

"Revenue update: $1,847 MRR

New users: 23
Churned: 2 (both said 'too simple')

I'll take 'too simple' over 'too overwhelming' every day."

### 3. Mini Wins & User Stories (25%)

**Purpose:** Social proof, celebration, community building

**Tweet Examples:**

"@user just went from 47 scattered notes to 3 clear projects with next steps in 5 minutes.

Their message: 'Holy shit, I can see what to do now.'

This is why we build 🚀"

---

"BuildOS user for 2 weeks:

Week 1: 'This feels too simple'
Week 2: 'Wait, I'm actually doing things'
Week 3: 'This is my home base now'

Simple + consistent > complex + abandoned"

---

"Student using BuildOS:

'Dumped my entire semester panic into it.
It showed me I only have 6 actual things to do.
Not 600.
Just 6.
I might actually pass.'

Clarity changes everything."

### 4. ADHD Productivity Tips (25%)

**Purpose:** Value-first content, build authority

**Tweet Examples:**

"ADHD productivity hack:

Stop organizing when you're avoiding.
Start executing when you have clarity.

The organization IS the procrastination.

Talk it out. See the next step. Do it."

---

"Your brain dump doesn't need categories.
It doesn't need tags.
It doesn't need a perfect system.

It needs to GET OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

Then let AI figure out the structure."

---

"Thread: Why your ADHD brain hates most productivity tools 🧵

1/ They require you to think linearly (you don't)
2/ They demand consistent structure (you're dynamic)
3/ They punish context switching (you're multi-track)
4/ They assume executive function (yours varies)

## Reply & Engagement Voice (Updated Jan 2026)

This section captures the authentic DJ voice for replies - learned from real engagement, not theory.

### Core Philosophy

**Be an insider sharing what's working, not a guru dispensing wisdom.**

You're in the trenches building with AI daily. You see what smart people are doing. Share that perspective directly without the preachy setup.

### The 3 Rules (Every Reply Must Pass)

1. **Can I visualize it?** - Use specific details, not abstract concepts
2. **Can I falsify it?** - Is this your real experience? Could you defend it if challenged?
3. **Can nobody else say this?** - Use your marines background, solo founder journey, ADHD brain

### Voice Principles

- Lowercase casual. perfect grammar not required.
- Short punchy sentences. fragments fine.
- Start with observation or reaction, not "I think..."
- Be direct. cut filler words.
- Longer replies are fine when you have real substance.

### How to Plug BuildOS

**Be self-aware about it.** Don't sneak it in. Call it out.

✅ Good:

- "**shameless plug incoming** - this is literally why i built build-os"
- "**shameless plug:** this is why i built build-os 😅"
- "a good place to do this is in build-os 😉"

❌ Bad:

- "this is why i'm building context infrastructure..." (sounds like thought leader speak)
- "your projects deserve to be remembered" (preachy, vague)
- Sneaking it in hoping people don't notice

### How to State Insights

**Lead with what smart people are already doing.** Position yourself as an insider observer, not a teacher.

✅ Good:

- "everyone across the board, if they are smart, is creating context by creating a ton of markdown files..."
- "this is exactly the pattern. everyone figures this out eventually..."
- "been building with claude code daily for 6 months. the pattern is clear..."

❌ Bad:

- "here's what's actually expensive..." (preachy setup)
- "this is why i'm obsessed with X over Y" (generic thought leader phrase)
- "the bottleneck isn't intelligence. it's memory." (sounds like a LinkedIn post)

### Playful Language

Use casual, vivid language when it fits. Makes you sound human, not like a content machine.

- "slurping up all that yummy slack context"
- "way too long to figure this out"
- "going for help billionaire status over here"

### Engaging Big Accounts

When replying to people like Shaan, Lenny, etc:

1. **Reference their content** - Show you actually follow them (pinned tweets, past themes)
2. **Ask direct questions** - "who should i be trying to impress with build-os.com?"
3. **Tie to their frameworks** - Use their language/concepts back at them
4. **Be cheeky, not sycophantic** - No "love this" or "great insight"

**Example (Shaan reply using his "Help Billionaire" concept):**

> ok but who should i be trying to impress?
>
> building build-os.com for scattered ADHD brains. going for "help billionaire" status over here.
>
> who's the right audience to care about?

### What NOT to Do

- Open with "love this" or "this resonated"
- Say "great post!" or generic praise
- Use phrases like "obsessed with X over Y"
- Sound preachy or lecture-y
- Hedge with "I think..." or "in my experience..."
- Write something that could've been written by anyone

---

## Key Metrics to Track

- Mentions of "home base" in replies
- Screenshots shared by users
- DMs asking for beta access
- Follower growth rate
- Engagement on ADHD content vs general
- Conversion from Twitter to beta signups

---

## Crisis Management

### If users complain about simplicity:

"We chose simple on purpose. Complex tools exist. They're abandoned. We're building for people who need to execute, not organize forever."

### If competitors attack:

Don't engage directly. Share user success stories instead.

### If features are requested:

"Noted! But first: are you using what exists? We add features only when current ones are fully loved."

---

**Month 3:** 5,000 followers, being mentioned as "home base"
