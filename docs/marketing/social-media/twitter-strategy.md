Just talk. AI organizes. You execute.

It's that simple.

## Content Pillars & Examples

### 1. Reality Checks (25%)

**Purpose:** Challenge productivity myths, validate struggles

**Tweet Examples:**

"Your Notion workspace is abandoned because you're not lazy.

You're overwhelmed.

Complex tools make scattered minds more scattered.

You need simplicity, not more features."

---

"Hot take: AI agents won't save your productivity.

You still need to decide what matters.
You still need to take action.
You still need to think.

AI should organize, not replace."

---

"That productivity guru's morning routine?

- 5am wake up
- 2 hour deep work
- Perfect time blocking

Your ADHD brain: 'lol no'

Build systems for your brain, not theirs."

### 2. Building in Public (25%)

**Purpose:** Transparency, relatability, trust-building

**Tweet Examples:**

"Today's ADHD moment:

Spent 2 hours building a feature.
Realized I built it last week.
Found 3 better ideas while looking for the old code.

This is why BuildOS has a 'what did I already do?' feature ðŸ˜…"

---

"User feedback: 'Can you make it yell at me to focus?'

Me: No, but what if it just... showed you the next tiny step?

Them: 'Oh. Yeah. That's better.'

Gentle momentum > harsh motivation"

---

"Revenue update: $1,847 MRR

New users: 23
Churned: 2 (both said 'too simple')

I'll take 'too simple' over 'too overwhelming' every day."

### 3. Mini Wins & User Stories (25%)

**Purpose:** Social proof, celebration, community building

**Tweet Examples:**

"@user just went from 47 scattered notes to 3 clear projects with next steps in 5 minutes.

Their message: 'Holy shit, I can see what to do now.'

This is why we build ðŸš€"

---

"BuildOS user for 2 weeks:

Week 1: 'This feels too simple'
Week 2: 'Wait, I'm actually doing things'
Week 3: 'This is my home base now'

Simple + consistent > complex + abandoned"

---

"Student using BuildOS:

'Dumped my entire semester panic into it.
It showed me I only have 6 actual things to do.
Not 600.
Just 6.
I might actually pass.'

Clarity changes everything."

### 4. ADHD Productivity Tips (25%)

**Purpose:** Value-first content, build authority

**Tweet Examples:**

"ADHD productivity hack:

Stop organizing when you're avoiding.
Start executing when you have clarity.

The organization IS the procrastination.

Talk it out. See the next step. Do it."

---

"Your brain dump doesn't need categories.
It doesn't need tags.
It doesn't need a perfect system.

It needs to GET OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

Then let AI figure out the structure."

---

"Thread: Why your ADHD brain hates most productivity tools ðŸ§µ

1/ They require you to think linearly (you don't)
2/ They demand consistent structure (you're dynamic)
3/ They punish context switching (you're multi-track)
4/ They assume executive function (yours varies)

### If competitors attack:

Don't engage directly. Share user success stories instead.

### If features are requested:

"Noted! But first: are you using what exists? We add features only when current ones are fully loved."
