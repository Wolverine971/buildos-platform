> **Purpose:** Position DJ as a thought leader in context engineering and AI productivity while building awareness for BuildOS

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-06

## Strategic Context

### Why LinkedIn?

LinkedIn differs fundamentally from Twitter/X:

| Aspect             | Twitter/X                             | LinkedIn                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Audience**       | ADHD community, indie hackers, casual | Founders, VCs, tech leaders, professionals |
| **Tone**           | Casual, punchy, memes ok              | Professional but authentic, storytelling   |
| **Content Length** | Short, threads                        | Longer-form posts (1,000-3,000 chars)      |
| **Engagement**     | Quick replies, RT culture             | Thoughtful comments, relationship building |
| **Algorithm**      | Recency + engagement                  | Early engagement, dwell time, comments     |
| **Networking**     | Follows are casual                    | Connections are professional relationships |
| **Best Topics**    | Hot takes, community                  | Insights, founder journey, industry POVs   |

### Your LinkedIn Positioning

**Primary Identity:** Builder/Founder working deeply with AI and context engineering

**Secondary Identity:** "Blue collar software engineering" — I tinker, I work, I build, I get it working. Through trial and error, find a system that works.

**Implicit Mission:** Raise curiosity about the problems BuildOS solves (context, memory, AI)

**Voice:** Learning voice, not authoritative. "This is what I've tried, this is what I've learned." AI/context engineering is all so new—speak from experience, not from "I have the answer."

### The Opportunity

LinkedIn is currently HOT for:

- AI agents discourse (lots of hype, little substance)
- "Building in public" founder stories
- Contrarian takes on productivity/tech
- Context engineering is NASCENT - you can own this

## Profile Optimization

### Headline (120 chars max)

**Primary Option:**

```
Building @BuildOS | Context engineering > AI agents | Making AI actually remember your work
```

**Alternative Options:**

```
Founder @BuildOS | Building context infrastructure for the AI era | ADHD productivity
```

```
Context Engineer | Building @BuildOS | AI should remember your projects, not start fresh
```

### About Section (2,600 chars max)

```markdown
At Curri, I was the integrations guy. I hooked up Uber, Lyft, DoorDash APIs—building systems that connected intelligently based on search radius, price, and criteria.

I was doing "agentic tool use" before anyone called it that.

Now I'm building BuildOS.

Here's the problem I kept hitting:
→ Scattered chats on random topics
→ Never going back to those chats
→ ChatGPT knows things about me but I don't know what it knows
→ Pasting the same documents into every new conversation

AI is already smart as fuck. But being smart is only one piece of the puzzle.

You need frameworks. You need context.

It's like JavaScript—you can code anything with it, but everyone uses React, Vue, Svelte. Same with AI. It knows everything, but you need a framework + context for it to give you actionable information.

So I'm building context infrastructure:
→ Brain dump → AI organizes
→ Projects with goals, milestones, plans, documents
→ An AI that actually knows where to look
→ Keep coming back to the same project and build on it

Background: Marine Corps (Scout Sniper), coding bootcamp, built document systems for the Air Force before LLMs existed.

I write from experience, not authority. AI/context engineering is too new for anyone to have the answers. I'm just sharing what I'm learning as I build.

Let's connect if you're thinking about context, AI, or building in public.
```

### Featured Section

1. **BuildOS link** - Main product
2. **Best LinkedIn post** - Context engineering explainer
3. **Blog post** - "Context vs Agent Engineering" or similar
4. **Interview/podcast** (when available)

## Content Pillars (LinkedIn-Adapted)

### Pillar 1: Context Engineering Thought Leadership (35%)

**Purpose:** Establish yourself as THE voice on context engineering vs AI agents

**Why this works on LinkedIn:**

- Technical enough for professionals
- Contrarian enough to spark engagement
- Positions you as forward-thinking
- Directly serves your goal of implicit BuildOS awareness

**Content Types:**

- "Hot takes" on AI agents hype
- Explaining context engineering concepts
- AI memory/context problems nobody talks about
- Future of AI productivity predictions

**Example Posts:**

```
At my last job, my manager wanted Linear kept up to date with progress.

My reaction: "Just look at my pull requests. This is such a hassle."

Linear wasn't helping me with my project.
It was only helping managers.

That's when I realized something:

Most project management tools are for managers, not makers.

What I actually wanted:
→ A thought partner that updates as I talk to it
→ Something that helps ME think, not just reports up
→ Context that builds over time

That's what I'm building at BuildOS.

(If you've ever felt like PM tools slow you down more than help, I'd love to hear your story)
```

```
MCPs and tool use are hot right now.

Here's what I'm learning:

You're not going to throw all the tools at AI and have it do a great job.
You need to give it the specific tools for the job.
Otherwise, the rest is noise.

I was connecting Uber, Lyft, DoorDash APIs at Curri.
Algorithm searched drivers based on search radius, price, time spent searching.
If criteria not met → fall back to next option.

This is "intelligent tool use"—and I was doing it before AI made it trendy.

The insight: It's not about how many tools you have.
It's about selecting the right tool for the context.

Same applies to AI agents.
```

### Pillar 2: Founder Journey / Building in Public (30%)

**Purpose:** Build trust, show authenticity, connect with other builders

**Why this works on LinkedIn:**

- Founder stories perform exceptionally well
- Shows your expertise through action, not claims
- Creates emotional connection
- Relatable to your target audience

**Content Types:**

- Weekly/monthly updates on BuildOS
- Challenges and how you're solving them
- Decisions and the thinking behind them
- Wins (small and big) with real numbers
- Failures and lessons learned

**Example Posts:**

```
Here's what I was wrong about when building BuildOS:

I loved the brain dump feature.
Users could just dump thoughts, AI would organize them.

But I should have gotten to agentic chat sooner.

Brain dumping is great—but the agent should talk back.
The agent knows shit too.

The pivot: Not just projects/tasks/calendars.
Projects with defined goals, documents, milestones, plans.

The system should help you get to the end state:
"Here's the goal. Here are milestones. Here's the plan. Here are tasks. Go step by step."

Speaking from experience, not authority here. This stuff is too new.

What are you learning as you build?
```

```
What keeps me up at night:

"Is BuildOS solving a real problem?"

It's solving it for me.
But explaining it to others is hard.
Differentiating from ChatGPT and Claude is hard.

What I love about it:
It's building context. That part is really powerful.

~70 signups. Few beta users. No active users yet.

I'm not pretending this is a rocketship.
I'm sharing the grind.

There's going to be a lot of trial and error.
Set yourself up for maximum iteration.
Talk to users sooner rather than later.

Anyone else in the "it works for me but how do I explain it?" phase?
```

### Pillar 3: AI + Productivity Insights (20%)

**Purpose:** Provide genuine value, attract target audience

**Why this works on LinkedIn:**

- Positions you as an expert
- Value-first content builds trust
- Attracts people who care about this space
- Natural lead-in to BuildOS concepts

**Content Types:**

- AI productivity tips (non-promotional)
- How-to content (using AI effectively)
- Framework shares
- Industry observations

**Example Posts:**

```
The context problem nobody talks about:

I kept pasting documents into ChatGPT.
Same context. Different chats.
Over and over.

ChatGPT knows about me.
But I don't know what it knows.

I wanted transparency:
"What does it know about me? Let me fill in the gaps."

I wanted a system that knows where to look.

This is context engineering.

It's not about prompts.
It's about: How do you pull in relevant information strategically?
With all the data possible, what's actually relevant to what you're trying to do?

If you want the AI agent to be good, you've got to give it the right context.

That's the core insight.
```

```
People are focused on tools.

They should be focused on building context about the user and their goals.

Context engineering = the information relevant to the task at hand.

It's not "feed AI everything."
It's "feed AI what matters for THIS moment."

You don't get more productive by budgeting time better.
You get more productive by getting clarity.

People are already doing their best.
They just need more clarity to be more productive.

If you get people thinking clearly, they'll be more productive.

That's the bet I'm making with BuildOS.
```

### Pillar 4: Contrarian Takes / Industry Commentary (15%)

**Purpose:** Spark engagement, establish unique POV

**Why this works on LinkedIn:**

- Contrarian content gets high engagement
- Positions you as a thinker, not just a builder
- Differentiates you from generic "founder" content
- Can be polarizing (good for algorithm)

**Content Types:**

- Challenges to conventional wisdom
- Hot takes on AI/productivity trends
- "Unpopular opinion" posts
- Industry critique

**Example Posts:**

```
Biggest productivity myth:

"Timeboxing makes you more productive."

No. Clarity of thought makes you more productive.

Biggest AI myth:

"Being smart/knowledge acquisition is the thing."

No. Systems and context around AI make it powerful.

Most productivity tools and project management apps slow you down.
You spend all your time organizing information and not executing.

I tinker. I work. I build. I get it working for me.
Through trial and error, I find a system that works.

Blue collar software engineering.

Not "I have the answer."
Just "piecing it together to make it useful."
```

```
Your second brain is a graveyard.

I have tons of stale notes in Obsidian.
Static. High maintenance to organize.
Never going back to them.

Same problem with Apple Notes.
Tons of notes. No organization.

Notion? Too complicated.
Moleskines? Physical, no AI.

Here's what I actually wanted:

A thing I could just talk to.
And it understands where I'm coming from.

Not a database I have to maintain.
A conversation I keep coming back to.

That's the difference.
```

## Engagement Strategy

### Who to Engage With

**Tier 1 - Engage Daily (Comment on most posts)**

- AI/ML thought leaders (actively posting about agents, context, productivity)
- Founder accounts in adjacent spaces (productivity, AI tools, knowledge management)
- VCs discussing AI trends
- People actively building in public
- Other solo founders shipping fast

**Tier 2 - Engage 2-3x/week**

- Productivity thought leaders
- Tech executives discussing AI adoption
- People complaining about AI limitations
- Indie hackers and builders

**Tier 3 - Engage weekly**

- General startup community
- Product managers discussing AI features
- Knowledge management / PKM community

### Engagement Rules

1. **Comment within 1 hour** - Early engagement matters on LinkedIn
2. **Add value, don't agree** - Extend the thought, share perspective
3. **Ask questions** - Opens dialogue, shows curiosity
4. **Be genuine** - LinkedIn users detect inauthenticity fast
5. **Never pitch in comments** - Only mention BuildOS if directly relevant and asked
6. **Comment length matters** - 2-4 sentences minimum, thoughtful
7. **Engage with other comments** - Creates threads, more visibility

### Comment Templates

**For AI agents posts:**

```
Interesting take. I've been thinking about this differently—agents are powerful but the context problem is real. Every new session starts from zero. What if the breakthrough isn't smarter agents, but agents with memory?
```

**For productivity posts:**

```
This resonates. I've found that [personal insight from your experience]. The challenge I keep hitting is [relevant struggle]. How do you handle that?
```

**For founder journey posts:**

```
Love the transparency here. Going through something similar with BuildOS—[relevant parallel]. What made you decide to [specific thing they mentioned]?
```

**For AI limitations posts:**

```
YES. This is the conversation nobody's having. AI amnesia is the real bottleneck. I've been calling this "the context problem"—[your insight]. Are you seeing solutions emerging?
```

### Connection Strategy

**Send connection requests to:**

- Anyone who engages meaningfully with your content
- People in your comments
- Speakers at AI/productivity conferences
- Authors of content you engage with
- People recommended by existing connections

**Connection message template:**

```
Hi [Name]—saw your post on [topic] and really resonated with [specific point]. I'm building in the AI productivity space and love connecting with others thinking about [their area]. Would be great to connect.
```

## Posting Schedule

### Optimal Times (Test and adjust)

| Day       | Time (EST)    | Why                          |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Tuesday   | 8:00-9:00 AM  | High activity, week starting |
| Wednesday | 12:00-1:00 PM | Lunch scroll                 |
| Thursday  | 8:00-9:00 AM  | Decision-maker peak          |

### Weekly Cadence

| Week | Post 1 (Tue)                       | Post 2 (Wed/Thu)               |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1    | Context Engineering (Pillar 1)     | Building in Public (Pillar 2)  |
| 2    | AI/Productivity Insight (Pillar 3) | Contrarian Take (Pillar 4)     |
| 3    | Context Engineering (Pillar 1)     | Building in Public (Pillar 2)  |
| 4    | AI/Productivity Insight (Pillar 3) | Context Engineering (Pillar 1) |

**Target:** 2-3 posts per week minimum

### Content Batching

Write 4-6 posts at once, schedule throughout the week. This helps maintain:

- Consistent voice
- Regular presence
- Strategic pillar balance

---

## LinkedIn-Specific Best Practices

### Post Format That Works

```
[Hook - 1-2 lines that stop the scroll]

[Empty line]

[Short paragraphs - 1-3 lines each]

[List or bullets if needed]

[Call to action or question]
```

### Hook Patterns

**Contrarian:** "Everyone's building X. Here's why that's wrong."
**Story:** "Last month, I almost made a huge mistake."
**Number:** "I've been building AI products for 2 years. Here's what I learned."
**Question:** "Why does AI forget everything?"
**Bold claim:** "AI agents are the new blockchain."

### Things to Avoid

- Corporate speak / jargon
- Only talking about your product
- Engagement bait without substance
- Tagging people for attention
- Commenting "Great post!" (add real value)
- Posting and disappearing (engage in your own comments)

### LinkedIn Algorithm Notes

- First hour engagement is critical
- Comments > reactions
- External links reduce reach (put in comments)
- Dwell time matters (longer content that people read)
- Images/carousels get higher reach
- Video is deprioritized unless native
