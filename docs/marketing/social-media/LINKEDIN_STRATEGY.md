## Strategic Context

### Why LinkedIn?

LinkedIn differs fundamentally from Twitter/X:

| Aspect             | Twitter/X                             | LinkedIn                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Audience**       | ADHD community, indie hackers, casual | Founders, VCs, tech leaders, professionals |
| **Tone**           | Casual, punchy, memes ok              | Professional but authentic, storytelling   |
| **Content Length** | Short, threads                        | Longer-form posts (1,000-3,000 chars)      |
| **Engagement**     | Quick replies, RT culture             | Thoughtful comments, relationship building |
| **Algorithm**      | Recency + engagement                  | Early engagement, dwell time, comments     |
| **Networking**     | Follows are casual                    | Connections are professional relationships |
| **Best Topics**    | Hot takes, community                  | Insights, founder journey, industry POVs   |

### Your LinkedIn Positioning

**Primary Identity:** Builder/Founder working deeply with AI agents & context engineering

**Secondary Identity:** Productivity thinker challenging conventional wisdom

**Implicit Mission:** Raise curiosity about the problems BuildOS solves (context, memory, AI)

### The Opportunity

LinkedIn is currently HOT for:

- AI agents discourse (lots of hype, little substance)
- "Building in public" founder stories
- Contrarian takes on productivity/tech
- Context engineering is NASCENT - you can own this

## Profile Optimization

### Headline (120 chars max)

**Primary Option:**

```
Building @BuildOS | Context engineering > AI agents | Making AI actually remember your work
```

**Alternative Options:**

```
Founder @BuildOS | Building context infrastructure for the AI era | ADHD productivity
```

```
Context Engineer | Building @BuildOS | AI should remember your projects, not start fresh
```

### About Section (2,600 chars max)

```markdown
I've abandoned Notion 6 times. Bought 47 planners. Tried every productivity system.

Why? I have ADHD, and traditional tools are designed for brains that don't work like mine.

Then I went deep into AI—and discovered something nobody was talking about:

The problem isn't that AI isn't smart enough.
The problem is AI has amnesia.

Every ChatGPT conversation starts from zero. You explain your project. Your constraints. Your context. Then close the chat and... it's gone.

This is insane.

So I'm building BuildOS—context infrastructure for the AI era.

What does that mean?
→ Brain dump once, context compounds forever
→ AI that actually knows YOUR projects
→ Goals, plans, tasks, documents—all connected
→ Zoom in to one task, zoom out to see everything

I write about:
• Context engineering (why it beats "AI agents")
• Building in public with ADHD
• The future of AI + productivity
• Contrarian takes on productivity culture

Currently: Deeply down the rabbit hole of making AI actually useful.

Let's connect if you're thinking about context, AI, or building products for scattered minds.
```

### Featured Section

1. **BuildOS link** - Main product
2. **Best LinkedIn post** - Context engineering explainer
3. **Blog post** - "Context vs Agent Engineering" or similar
4. **Interview/podcast** (when available)

### Banner Image

## Content Pillars (LinkedIn-Adapted)

### Pillar 1: Context Engineering Thought Leadership (35%)

**Purpose:** Establish yourself as THE voice on context engineering vs AI agents

**Why this works on LinkedIn:**

- Technical enough for professionals
- Contrarian enough to spark engagement
- Positions you as forward-thinking
- Directly serves your goal of implicit BuildOS awareness

**Content Types:**

- "Hot takes" on AI agents hype
- Explaining context engineering concepts
- AI memory/context problems nobody talks about
- Future of AI productivity predictions

**Example Posts:**

```
Everyone's obsessed with AI agents.

"Let the AI do it for you!"
"Autonomous workflows!"
"10x your productivity!"

Here's what nobody mentions:

These agents are stateless.

Every time you start a new chat, the AI knows nothing about:
- Your projects
- Your constraints
- Your history
- Your decisions

It's like having a brilliant assistant with total amnesia.

Context engineering > agent engineering.

AI that remembers beats AI that does.

(Building this at BuildOS)
```

```
I've been building with AI for 2 years.

Here's what I wish someone told me day 1:

The context window isn't a limitation.
It's the entire game.

What you feed AI matters more than which model you use.

Structured context + GPT-4 beats unstructured prompts + any model.

This is context engineering.

And almost nobody talks about it.
```

### Pillar 2: Founder Journey / Building in Public (30%)

**Purpose:** Build trust, show authenticity, connect with other builders

**Why this works on LinkedIn:**

- Founder stories perform exceptionally well
- Shows your expertise through action, not claims
- Creates emotional connection
- Relatable to your target audience

**Content Types:**

- Weekly/monthly updates on BuildOS
- Challenges and how you're solving them
- Decisions and the thinking behind them
- Wins (small and big) with real numbers
- Failures and lessons learned

**Example Posts:**

```
Last month I almost pivoted BuildOS.

A VC said: "AI agents are hot. You should build agents."

I said: "We're building context infrastructure."

They said: "Nobody searches for that."

Here's why I didn't pivot:

Every AI agent product I've tried has the same problem.
Smart AI. Zero memory.

Agents don't fix the fundamental issue:
AI doesn't know YOUR work.

So I'm betting on context.

Maybe I'm wrong. But I'd rather build what I believe in than chase what's hot.

Anyone else choosing the contrarian path?
```

```
Revenue update: $2,847 MRR

What's working:
→ Users who try brain dump → 80% retention
→ Daily brief feature → most requested
→ "It finally remembers" → top feedback theme

What's hard:
→ Explaining "context infrastructure" (it's abstract)
→ Competing with "AI agents" SEO
→ Getting people to trust a new category

Lesson: The best product in the world doesn't matter if you can't explain it in 10 seconds.

Working on that.
```

### Pillar 3: AI + Productivity Insights (20%)

**Purpose:** Provide genuine value, attract target audience

**Why this works on LinkedIn:**

- Positions you as an expert
- Value-first content builds trust
- Attracts people who care about this space
- Natural lead-in to BuildOS concepts

**Content Types:**

- AI productivity tips (non-promotional)
- How-to content (using AI effectively)
- Framework shares
- Industry observations

**Example Posts:**

```
The best AI prompt I've ever written wasn't clever.

It was context.

Here's what I included:
→ Who I am and what I'm working on
→ My constraints and preferences
→ What I've already tried
→ The specific outcome I need
→ Examples of good/bad outputs

The AI's response? Better than any "prompt engineering" trick.

Context >> clever prompts.

This is true for every AI tool.
More context = better outputs.

But nobody wants to re-type their context every conversation.

(That's what I'm solving.)
```

```
5 things I do every morning that actually work for my ADHD brain:

1. Brain dump for 60 seconds (no structure, just words)
2. Look at ONE thing to do first (not the whole list)
3. Tell AI what I'm working on (context first)
4. Set a 25-minute timer (not goals, just time)
5. Forgive yesterday (it's gone)

Notice what's missing:
- Perfect morning routine
- Elaborate system setup
- Notion template organization
- Goal visualization

ADHD brains need momentum, not perfection.
```

### Pillar 4: Contrarian Takes / Industry Commentary (15%)

**Purpose:** Spark engagement, establish unique POV

**Why this works on LinkedIn:**

- Contrarian content gets high engagement
- Positions you as a thinker, not just a builder
- Differentiates you from generic "founder" content
- Can be polarizing (good for algorithm)

**Content Types:**

- Challenges to conventional wisdom
- Hot takes on AI/productivity trends
- "Unpopular opinion" posts
- Industry critique

**Example Posts:**

```
Unpopular opinion:

AI agents are the new blockchain.

Everyone's building them.
VCs are funding them.
Nobody's actually using them.

Why?

Agents have a context problem.
They're smart but have amnesia.

In 3 years, we'll talk about "AI agents" like we talk about "web3 productivity tools" today.

What will remain?
Context. Memory. Personalization.

AI that knows YOUR work beats AI that does generic work.

Fight me in the comments.
```

```
Productivity advice I've stopped following:

❌ "Eat the frog first" (my frog changes hourly)
❌ "Time block everything" (my brain laughs)
❌ "Use ONE tool consistently" (I need flexibility)
❌ "Review your goals daily" (executive dysfunction says no)
❌ "Morning routine" (every day is different)

What actually works:

✅ Capture thoughts the moment they appear
✅ Let AI handle structure
✅ One next step, not ten
✅ Progress over perfection
✅ Build systems for YOUR brain

Productivity culture is optimized for neurotypical brains.
Most of us don't have those.
```

## Engagement Strategy

### Who to Engage With

**Tier 1 - Engage Daily (Comment on most posts)**

- AI/ML thought leaders (actively posting about agents, context, productivity)
- Founder accounts in adjacent spaces (productivity, AI tools, ADHD)
- VCs discussing AI trends
- People actively building in public

**Tier 2 - Engage 2-3x/week**

- Productivity thought leaders
- Tech executives discussing AI adoption
- ADHD/neurodivergent professionals
- People complaining about AI limitations

**Tier 3 - Engage weekly**

- General startup community
- Product managers discussing AI features
- Enterprise AI accounts

### Engagement Rules

1. **Comment within 1 hour** - Early engagement matters on LinkedIn
2. **Add value, don't agree** - Extend the thought, share perspective
3. **Ask questions** - Opens dialogue, shows curiosity
4. **Be genuine** - LinkedIn users detect inauthenticity fast
5. **Never pitch in comments** - Only mention BuildOS if directly relevant and asked
6. **Comment length matters** - 2-4 sentences minimum, thoughtful
7. **Engage with other comments** - Creates threads, more visibility

### Comment Templates

**For AI agents posts:**

```
Interesting take. I've been thinking about this differently—agents are powerful but the context problem is real. Every new session starts from zero. What if the breakthrough isn't smarter agents, but agents with memory?
```

**For productivity posts:**

```
This resonates. I've found that [personal insight from your experience]. The challenge I keep hitting is [relevant struggle]. How do you handle that?
```

**For founder journey posts:**

```
Love the transparency here. Going through something similar with BuildOS—[relevant parallel]. What made you decide to [specific thing they mentioned]?
```

**For AI limitations posts:**

```
YES. This is the conversation nobody's having. AI amnesia is the real bottleneck. I've been calling this "the context problem"—[your insight]. Are you seeing solutions emerging?
```

### Connection Strategy

**Send connection requests to:**

- Anyone who engages meaningfully with your content
- People in your comments
- Speakers at AI/productivity conferences
- Authors of content you engage with
- People recommended by existing connections

**Connection message template:**

```
Hi [Name]—saw your post on [topic] and really resonated with [specific point]. I'm building in the AI productivity space and love connecting with others thinking about [their area]. Would be great to connect.
```

## Posting Schedule

### Optimal Times (Test and adjust)

| Day       | Time (EST)    | Why                          |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Tuesday   | 8:00-9:00 AM  | High activity, week starting |
| Wednesday | 12:00-1:00 PM | Lunch scroll                 |
| Thursday  | 8:00-9:00 AM  | Decision-maker peak          |

### Weekly Cadence

| Week | Post 1 (Tue)                       | Post 2 (Wed/Thu)               |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1    | Context Engineering (Pillar 1)     | Building in Public (Pillar 2)  |
| 2    | AI/Productivity Insight (Pillar 3) | Contrarian Take (Pillar 4)     |
| 3    | Context Engineering (Pillar 1)     | Building in Public (Pillar 2)  |
| 4    | AI/Productivity Insight (Pillar 3) | Context Engineering (Pillar 1) |

**Target:** 2-3 posts per week minimum

### Content Batching

Write 4-6 posts at once, schedule throughout the week. This helps maintain:

- Consistent voice
- Regular presence
- Strategic pillar balance

---

## LinkedIn-Specific Best Practices

### Post Format That Works

```
[Hook - 1-2 lines that stop the scroll]

[Empty line]

[Short paragraphs - 1-3 lines each]

[List or bullets if needed]

[Call to action or question]
```

### Hook Patterns

**Contrarian:** "Everyone's building X. Here's why that's wrong."
**Story:** "Last month, I almost made a huge mistake."
**Number:** "I've been building AI products for 2 years. Here's what I learned."
**Question:** "Why does AI forget everything?"
**Bold claim:** "AI agents are the new blockchain."

### Things to Avoid

- Corporate speak / jargon
- Only talking about your product
- Engagement bait without substance
- Tagging people for attention
- Commenting "Great post!" (add real value)
- Posting and disappearing (engage in your own comments)

### LinkedIn Algorithm Notes

- First hour engagement is critical
- Comments > reactions
- External links reduce reach (put in comments)
- Dwell time matters (longer content that people read)
- Images/carousels get higher reach
- Video is deprioritized unless native

## Relationship with Twitter Strategy

### Same Voice, Different Depth

| Aspect           | Twitter         | LinkedIn              |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| Core message     | Same            | Same                  |
| Personality      | Same            | Same                  |
| Content depth    | Short, punchy   | Longer, more nuanced  |
| Audience focus   | ADHD community  | Tech professionals    |
| Engagement style | Quick, frequent | Thoughtful, strategic |
| Product mentions | More casual     | More implicit         |

### Cross-Posting Strategy

- Don't directly cross-post (different formats)
- Same ideas can be expanded for LinkedIn
- Link between platforms in bio, not posts
- Keep Twitter for ADHD community, LinkedIn for professional positioning
