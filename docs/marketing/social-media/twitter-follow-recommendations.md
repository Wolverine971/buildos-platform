## Why @dexhorthy is Critical

Dex Horthy (@dexhorthy) coined the term "Context Engineering" and has become the defining voice in this space.

### Key Contributions

1. **12-Factor Agents Manifesto** - Patterns of reliable LLM applications, many points relate directly to context engineering ("own your prompts", "own your context building", etc.)

2. **Harness Engineering** - New concept applying context engineering principles to how you use existing agents. For Claude Code, this includes commands, hooks, skills, agents, MCPs that you plug into the existing harness.

3. **Core Philosophy** - "The main thing that determines whether an Agent succeeds or fails is the quality of the context you give it. Most agent failures are not model failures anymore - they are context failures."

### Why This Matters for BuildOS

His framing aligns perfectly with your positioning:

- "Context > Intelligence" = his core message
- "AI that remembers" = context engineering in practice
- "Most agent failures are context failures" = validates your entire product thesis
