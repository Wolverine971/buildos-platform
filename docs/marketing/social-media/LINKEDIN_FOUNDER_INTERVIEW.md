## Section 1: Your Origin Story

### The Problem That Led to BuildOS

1. What specific moment or frustration made you decide to build BuildOS? (Not the polished pitch - the real "fuck this" moment)

2. What were you doing/working on when you hit that wall?

3. What tools had you tried before? What specifically didn't work about each one?

4. How long did you struggle with this problem before deciding to build something?

Okay, origin story. What specific moment of frustration made you decide to build DALL·S? I was finding that I was having a bunch of chats on random topics, and I would never go back to my chats, and I was frustrated with the idea of not building context. And the AI, like ChatGPT, knows about me, but I don't know exactly what it knows about me, what details it extracted to know about me. I wish I could interact with it, and save certain things so that it could, like, know about certain things about me. And I wanted it to be transparent, like, what it knows about me versus... so that I can, like, fill in the gaps and stuff like that. Uh, what were you doing when you hit that wall? Yeah, I was just interfacing with a bunch of chats, and just frustrated with the idea of, like, context, and I was pasting in documents. I was creating documents and pasting in documents to do certain things, and I was like, I don't want to just keep pasting in documents. I want this to be a system that kind of knows where to look for things. Yeah, I had tried Notion before. That's a tool I tried before that, like, was too complicated. I didn't want to keep coming back to that one. I tried Obsidian before. But again, these are, like, static things that, like, take a lot of maintenance to organize all your information. And I would also have a ton of notes in Apple Notes, and a ton of Moleskines. And yeah, I've continually been trying to solve this problem by trying new systems. But I wanted, basically, a thing that I could just talk to, and it understands where I'm coming from.

### Your Background

5. What's your professional background before BuildOS? (engineering, product, design, other?)

6. Have you built products/startups before? What happened with them?

7. What skills do you bring that make you the right person to build this?

8. What skills are you learning/struggling with as you build?

Okay, what's my background? Professional background, I was in the Marine Corps for five years, USMC, got in 2012 and left in 2017, and I got, I was infantry with 311, and I joined a sniper platoon, got into the sniper, and became a scout sniper for 317, and then I tried out for MARSOC, Marine Corps Special Operations, and I didn't get selected, so I was like, screw this, I'm getting out of the Marine Corps, I'm going to go try to become an entrepreneur. I was reading a lot of technical, Tim Ferriss books, and Tim Ferriss said basically like, if you want to have a chance of succeeding as an entrepreneur, you need to be technical, because if you're not technical, you're going to be at the mercy of whoever is technical to build out your idea. So I was like, okay, I need to become technical. So I joined a coding boot camp, and then got into coding, and it was a coding boot camp based out of LA, Los Angeles. It was called Sabio, and the founder was an old Myspace guy who worked for Myspace, so he's kind of an OG. I learned everything there, I didn't have any technical background before, like I didn't know coding, but it just taught me everything. And also funny enough, I took a new programming class in community college before I joined the Marines, and I failed that class. It was too complicated, I didn't get it, but this coding boot camp really taught me a lot, and I got into it, loved it, and I was like doing the demos and stuff, and basically after the coding boot camp, I was hired on to work at Sabio. I did that for a little bit, and left, and then I came back to the East Coast, and I got a job on the East Coast working at the U.S. Census Bureau. And the Census Bureau, we were building this thing where you could try to make the Census Bureau data readily accessible. Anyway, I did that for a little bit. Then I worked for another company. I don't remember. I worked on a company that actually helped Marine Corps and some platform for Marine Corps lawyers to do stuff, search cases, and also build an intelligence document ingest system for the Air Force where you can ingest documents and make them searchable. And this was before AI did that. But then my most recent I was working at a Y Combinator-backed startup called Curri, which is a delivery logistics company. And I did a bunch of stuff there. I helped build this exception system where we have dispatchers who are figuring out how to get deliveries from A to B. And people would just monitor these deliveries and just kind of see what's going on. But we changed the system so that they'd be proactively pinged. We have a queue system. So they'd be pinged every time there's an issue with a delivery. So basically, they can chill and then get pinged when they need to do something. Built that, and then I worked on a map visualization thing. But I did a lot of stuff at Curri. Loved it. Great company. And that really just got me excited about entrepreneurship. But I was also working on something on the side, Ninetakes, which is like an Enneagram or Reddit based on the Enneagram. But basically, after I left Curri, I was looking at jobs. This is when AI started to come out, and it's hard to get a job. And so I thought, you know what? I think I can just work on my own thing. Because I'll put a lot of work into it, and I think I'll be able to succeed if I just work on something my own. I'll put all my effort into working on something for now, and then I'll probably make more progress that way.

So yeah, as far as skills, I was kind of self-engineering, I was doing mostly front-end work, but then I got more into the back-end, and basically doing full-stack. Yeah, I built products before, I built mind-takes, and I built a few sites for people. I also built the Cadre training, it was a buddy of mine who was an old scout sniper friend, and I built that site for him. I built a site with another friend called Tiny Tribe Adventures, where you kind of... It gives you suggestions for places to go with your family, your tiny tribe, so you can plan day trips and stuff like that. It was map-based, so I'd always been tinkering with ideas. But they didn't totally go anywhere, and with BuildOS, I feel like I was early to the idea of context engineering, and I was like, if I build this now, there's a good chance that this will succeed, because building context is so... awesome. It really compounds when you build context. Yes, guys, do you bring that make you the right person for this? I think I'm very action-oriented. I'm an indie-grammy, I just dive in head-first and figure it out as I go. And I think I've made a lot of progress as a solo entrepreneur, or solo founder. But yeah, I'm good at prototyping, I'm good at getting stuff going and diving into the details. What skills am I learning? Like I said, I'm an act-first, ask-questions-later kind of person. So I think one thing that I'm working on is that. I don't create a perfect plan, I just start working. And it's hard for me to step back if you get the big picture, because I want to get stuff going fast and move forward. When you're building a whole system, it is important to step back. And I've been continuously stepping back as it builds into this to reanalyze how everything fits together. But I think also, it's kind of like, I wouldn't have made it this far. Not many people would have made it this far. I feel like a lot of the lessons I've learned, I've learned by making mistakes and going through them. I think I've figured out a lot of things first-hand about AI and context engineering and what each of the apps that not many people know about, or only have a peripheral understanding of.

## Section 2: Your Relationship with Productivity & ADHD

### Your Brain

9. Do you have ADHD? If so, when were you diagnosed? How did that change things?

10. How would you describe how your brain works to someone who doesn't get it?

11. What's a typical "bad brain day" look like for you?

12. What's a typical "good brain day" look like?

I don't have ADHD. My wife maybe thinks I do, but I do lose focus sometimes. But like, I can also grind and like focus and lock in for long periods of time. Usually my days are spent like several hours coding long coding stints. So, I don't think I have ADHD. How would you describe how your brain works if somebody doesn't get it? I would say... I think I'm an enneagram 8. I'm an enneagram 8, so that really describes me. I'm action-oriented. I do get restless. I get annoyed at slow progress. I'm always thinking in terms of like contrarian kind of thoughts. Like, what do I know that most people don't know? What are people missing? What is the opposite point of view? That kind of stuff. I like to stress test ideas. A typical bad brain day for me is like where I've worked for a lot and I feel like I haven't accomplished a lot. I am right now very reliant on energy drinks and coffee, so that's not great. A good brain day is when I wake up early and get a good chunk of work done in the morning and then keep doing a bunch of stuff. That's a good brain day for me.

### Your Productivity Journey

13. What productivity systems/tools have you actually tried? (Be specific - Notion, Todoist, paper, GTD, etc.)

14. For each one: What made you try it? What made you stop?

15. What's the longest you've stuck with any system? What made that one work longer?

16. What do most productivity tools assume about users that's wrong for you?

Okay, so Product Studio Assistants and Tools. I've tried, I like the Pomodoro technique where you tiebox whatever you're working on and take a break. That's really helpful, but I also think that I get a lot done if I work for just a long, continuous stint. Yeah, I tried Notion, um, and I tried Obsidian for just regular data capture. Um, but yeah, I like to-do lists, basic to-do lists. And I also like just defining our goal and reverse engineering how to get there. Um, and just diving into that complexity, and that's one of the things I like. I tried to build it to build a list. Um, I think, I've tried a few tools, but like, I think the productivity space is mostly, like, I think I'm kind of stuck on one. I think productivity is, like, the thing I'm struggling with is building context and making, like, building off of what I just wrote. And, like, creating good checkpoints for people. Um, and not, um, trying to rebuild all the context that I did previously have. A basic to-do list, I just methodically looked into the list. That gets me, kind of. Um, uh, yeah, I haven't stuck with the system very long. I've used Obsidian for a while. I've still got a ton of notes there, but nothing's, like, it's, like, stale data. Um, I really would like to upload all those notes to Quad, and have Quad, like, work with them. Um, can I collaborate with these notes? Um, most productivity tools just take a long time to get set up. That's why I wanted it to build a list. I think an assistant, if you just talk to it, it freaking does stuff for you. And you can search. It's like a text search, but, like, it should primarily be based off of just talking about whatever you've got going on. And it should talk back. It should tell you what you've got going on. Because it already knows your data and context and already understands what's going on.

## Section 3: Building BuildOS

### The Product Journey

17. When did you start building BuildOS? What was the first version like?

18. What's the biggest pivot or change you've made based on user feedback?

19. What feature are you most proud of? Why?

20. What feature do users love that surprised you?

21. What have you built that totally flopped?

I started building BuildOS shortly after I got, I left Kuri. The first version was all focused on productivity. And it was just a, I had it as projects and life goals. And then I was like, actually no, just make everything projects, because a life goal can be a project. It was just a grouping of information that's surrounded by an end state. It's like you're at point A, you're trying to get to point B. You know, what all information is associated with that. And so I had that, and I had tasks, and then I could have calendar events. So basically I had tasks, scheduling, stuff like that. And it was all based around brain dumping. But there's a few things that changed. One was that brain dumping is great, but you want the agent to talk back, because the agent knows shit too. And I want to brain dump information and have the AI intelligently organize it. And so I wanted to build a better chat interface where the agent can kind of help you. They can do stuff. The other thing is I don't want just projects and tasks and calendars. I want projects with defined goals, with documents on different pieces of the project. And I want milestones. I want the system to kind of help you get towards where you're trying to go by saying, hey, this is the end goal. These are the milestones to get there. So here's the plan, and here are the tasks associated with that. So you can just like methodically go through this step by step. So one feature I'm proud of, I'm proud of the agentic chat where you can just chat with the OS. It's really working well with understanding the tools and everything. I think people are going to love how just the system kind of knows what you have got going on. It can do stuff for you. And I think it also, I like the ontology and the graph view of the ontology. I think it kind of works nicely because we think in terms of goals and tasks and stuff like that. Yeah, the thing that totally flopped is like just simple projects and tasks. I think you need a more dynamic thing. I'm trying to become like the palantir or develop an ontology for projects so that like any project, Buoldos can handle any project and kind of like gracefully organize the data and get you to where you want to go.

### Current State

22. Where is BuildOS right now? (Users, revenue, stage - whatever you're comfortable sharing)

23. What's the hardest problem you're solving right now?

24. What keeps you up at night about the business?

25. What makes you most excited about what's coming?

A little less. We have like 70 something users, but no ideally active users, people that signed up. And I got a few beta users too, but no active users. Hardest problem we're solving right now is making it as good as ChatGPT and figuring out how to market it. What keeps me up at night is like, is it going to solve a real problem? It's solving a problem for me, but explaining that to other people is kind of hard. And trying to differentiate it from ChatGPT and Claude to get that is kind of hard. But I like that it's building context right now. I love that part. I think it's really powerful, but I'm just kind of worried that people are going to pay for it. It's useful, really useful for me, but I'm trying to figure out how to bridge the gap so other people can understand how useful it is.

---

## Section 4: Your Take on AI & Context

### The Context Engineering Angle

26. In your own words, what is "context engineering"? (Not the marketing definition - how you actually think about it)

27. Why do you believe context > agents? What's the core insight?

28. What's wrong with how most people are building AI products right now?

29. What do you think most AI tools get wrong about productivity?

Conduct engineering to me is the information that is relevant to whatever the task at hand is. So it's like, how do you pull in relevant information? You pull in relevant information strategically, like in an argument, you're referencing separate things. If you're trying to accomplish a goal, you're going to look at certain data, certain indicators that prove you right or wrong, or whatever. So it's relevant information to whatever you're trying to do. So the thing is that context, it makes your agent smell like AI, LLMs are like trying to get all the data possible, but it's like, okay, with all that information possible, what's relevant to whatever you're trying to do? So you've got to personalize it to the person, and that's why brain dumping is so important, and building context is so important. If you want the AI agent to be good, you've got to give it the right context. That's the core insight. Right now, one of the big things that's wrong with people building AI products right now is that they're focused on tools, but they should be focused on building context about the user and the goals and stuff like that. What most AI tools give productivity is that people are all doing the best they can. If you want to be more productive, you need clearer thinking. I think that is the 80-20 analysis. It's not about managing your time it's about clarity. If you get people thinking clearly, then you'll be more productive.

### Your AI Usage

30. How do you actually use AI in your daily work?

31. What's the most impressive thing AI has done for you?

32. What's the most frustrating AI experience you've had?

33. What do you wish AI could do that it can't yet?

So I use all, most of the AI tools. I use ChatGPT, I use Claude Code, I use OpenAI's Codex too, these multiple coding tools, but also just Claude and ChatGPT for regular browser-based chats. Just random questions and stuff like that, but when I have a project, I go back to Build-OS because that's where I'm storing all my information. It's like I'm building something. Impressive thing that AI has done for me? It's kind of hard because like if I wanted to do something impressive, I really got to prompt it well. Like, this is a silly example. I asked it about gardening and to create a gardening schedule. That's pretty simple and straightforward. It just needs to look at that stuff, but it really needs to understand where I'm coming from in order to be really great. It's frustrating when AI kind of mentions something in a chat that is from a previous chat that you didn't know it knew about you. It's like I'd rather it be transparent about what it knows about me and what it doesn't know about me. That's kind of not great. I wish right now AI was more productive or proactive with what it does. That's what I'm trying to get Build-OS to do. It has all this context on me, and I'll go proactively do stuff.

## Section 5: Hot Takes & Contrarian Views

### Things You Believe That Others Don't

34. What's a belief you hold about productivity that most people would disagree with?

35. What's a belief you hold about AI that most people would disagree with?

36. What's a belief you hold about building startups that most people would disagree with?

37. What popular advice do you think is actually harmful?

For hot ticks in the country, I believe they can hold a lot more tariff than people would disagree with. I don't know if people would disagree with it, but that's kind of what I hear someone say. I think people are already doing their best, and they just need more clarity in order to be more productive. And I don't think you're going to be that more productive by budgeting tariff. Maybe that's a controversial view. A brief about AI, I don't know if you would disagree with that thing. One common misperception is that AI is already smart as fuck. It's already really smart, but being smart is only one piece of the puzzle. You need to give it frameworks for what to do in order for it to actually be smart. It's kind of like a programming language. There's JavaScript. You can potentially code anything with JavaScript, but everyone uses a JavaScript framework. React, Vue, and Scalp. Because these frameworks help you get to where you're going faster. They clarify a lot of built-in stuff. The same thing with AI. It knows everything, but you need to give it a framework for it to give you actionable information that's good for you. And that framework, along with the context, makes AI feel good. A brief about building startups. I really like the idea of one strong leader, Steve Jobs, driving the boat. He was like, hey, we need to do this. I like the idea of Brian Chesky saying founder mode. Founders just got to take over. That's not everything he meant by founder mode. You got to drive the ship. And I think, yeah, I feel like as a founder, I got to steer it into a specific direction. And it doesn't really make sense right now because I am a solo founder. But I'm also like, because I'm a solo founder, I can get a lot of shit done because I'm steering the boat. I do want to bring on other people to help augment my skills and bring different things to the table. But right now, I think one misconception is you can't just bring in smart people and let them do stuff. You need to have very specific goals. You need to adapt people. But I think you need to be very aligned with your team. And that's the only thing that BuildOS is also trying to solve is when you bring in sharing capabilities, it's going to be nice because you can all be sharing the same content on a project. Yeah, I kind of said that too. Pop device, it's harmful. I think most productivity tools and project management apps, they slow you down because you spend all your time organizing information and not executing. That was one of my frustrations at Curri. He's linear. He spends so much time fucking with linear rather than working. I wish I could just bring up information in a conversation and have AI extract all the information about my progress. And then my manager or whatever could just query the AI, like, what did you do to get done? And it already knows about everything I got done and everything I said I got done. And it could tell my manager and it could basically be like, hey, what about this? And so it could ping me about different things that I didn't get done. But if you're all working through AI intermediary, I think you could get a lot more done. Because it makes me think about this one thing about what gets measured. Not all that gets measured counts and all that counts gets measured. It's kind of like the idea of people have a false sense of security when they are looking at data. It's like, does this data actually explain what I have wanted to explain? That's one of the things that I think is kind of rough. Is that data can be used to skew the truth as opposed to reveal the truth. That's just one thing.

### Things That Annoy You

38. What trends in the AI space annoy you? Why?

39. What trends in productivity culture annoy you? Why?

40. What type of LinkedIn content makes you cringe?

One trend that annoys me is MCPs and tool use. You're not just going to throw all the tools at AI and it's going to do a great job. You need to give it the specific tools that it needs to do the job. Otherwise, the rest of it is noise. Trends in productivity culture? I hate the idea of having a very packed calendar. I'd rather the calendar be like time blocks for different things. I hate meetings back to back. That's just the worst. One thing I hate about LinkedIn is that everyone's trying to be a thought leader and just be so inauthentic and not real. I know other people will be speaking from personal experience but it's kind of hard to do that because you're working with employers, but yeah.

## Section 6: Specific Stories

### Wins

41. Tell me about a user who "got it" - what happened? What did they say?

42. Tell me about a moment when you knew you were onto something with BuildOS.

43. What's a small win recently that felt meaningful?

So one user who got it, they just wanted help with organization. There's scattered ideas everywhere and they just wanted help organizing everything. And they actually asked for a feature request where they were asking about, I just want to be able to say I want to work on X project and then clear my schedule so I can focus on that and tell me what I should work on for that. I know I was on to something when BuildLS started becoming meaningful, or not meaningful but useful to me, where I could extrapolate and build on my projects. That was kind of an indicator. The agentic chat is just more responsive and working and that's a big win. For me.

### Failures & Lessons

44. Tell me about a time you were wrong about something important in building BuildOS.

45. What's a mistake you made that you learned a lot from?

46. What's something you thought would work that totally didn't?

Um, tell me about a time when I was wrong about something in BuildOS. I think I love the idea of brain dumps, but it was more of like, I need to get into the authentic chat sooner. Just give the chat specific tools and make it smarter. Um, I'm just, one mistake that I've learned from is not to speak as a authoritative voice, but as a learning voice, because this is, this AI and LLMs and context engineering is all so new that I don't want to be speaking from a position of authority. I want to be speaking from an experience, position of experience, as in this is what I've tried, this is what I've learned. Um, what I think would work that totally wouldn't work was daily briefs. Uh, daily briefs are good, but there's a lot of bloat in them and it requires a lot of refining. Like, as opposed to getting a brief about what you should care about, you should ask about certain things. It's just hard to get that, that balance right.

### Funny/Relatable Moments

47. What's a funny or embarrassing moment from building this?

48. What's something that happened that perfectly captures the chaos of being a founder?

49. What's a "only in startups" moment you've had?

IDK

## Section 7: Your Voice & Style

### How You Communicate

50. When you're explaining BuildOS to a friend, what do you actually say?

51. What words or phrases do you naturally use a lot?

52. What's your sense of humor like? (dry, self-deprecating, absurdist, etc.)

53. Do you swear in professional contexts? How casual do you get?

When I'm explaining BuildOS to a friend, I say BuildOS is an AI project collaboration tool where you brain dump information and it builds context for you. And then I talk about how like anything could be a project and you can just talk to it and it structures it for you and the nice thing is that you can keep going back to this. So it's like any project that you're going to keep coming back to, you can just store in BuildOS as opposed to ChatGPT and you can just keep coming back to it and keep building on the last conversation or last place where you made progress. I sort of explain it that way. Words or phrases I use a lot. AI project collaboration, brain dump information, it's organized. I always say talk about context a lot and how you keep coming back to the same word or same project. That's one thing I talk about a lot. My sense of humor, I don't know, dude. Combination of things, kind of sometimes dark humor. Do I swear in professional context? I try not to swear in professional context.

### Your Influences

54. Who do you admire in the tech/startup space? Why?

55. Whose content do you enjoy consuming? (podcasts, newsletters, twitter accounts)

56. Who's doing LinkedIn well in your opinion?

There are a lot of people that I admire in the tech star space. I like the My First Million guys, Sean Purri, and Sam Parr. I like all the Y Combinator people. Y Combinator kind of annoys me because I was so close to it and now I feel backstabbed because I haven't gotten into Y Combinator, but I do appreciate those founders, like they know and have learned a lot. One thing I like about My First Million is that these guys are like gritty and they like, can I get stuff done from a less academic way of like, more of like hard work and like figuring things out and just grinding stuff. Like I really like Elon Musk for his grind. I also like Greg Isenberg and Dan Shipper and Tim Ferriss. A few other people, but that's who I can think of right now. Whose content do you enjoy on Zoom? I like the podcast How to Take Over the World by Ben Wilson. Lenny's newsletter is really good its on youtube and on twitter account. But I just watch stuff in general on YouTube. I don't know anybody who's doing well on LinkedIn in my opinion.

## Section 8: Goals & Positioning

### What You Want from LinkedIn

57. When someone sees your LinkedIn content, what do you want them to think about you?

58. What do you NOT want to come across as?

59. What kind of people do you want to attract?

60. What conversations do you want to be part of?

When someone sees my LinkedIn content, I want them to know that I'm actively working on something, building something, that I was in the military, that I'm an engineer, software engineer, and I build stuff, I work hard, and I'm on to something. What do you not want to know? I don't want to overly accentuate my military credentials, because I know too many people who make that their whole thing. I want to be a smart guy, a capable person in the domain of software engineering, and then being in the military, having a military pass is a bonus. Yeah, I don't want to come off as preachy. I want to be more like the guy who's a hustler and a grinder, who just works hard and does good stuff. I want to attract smart people, and people who are curious and build stuff and hack things together, that kinds of things. And I want to attract people who are humble but ambitious. I want to be a part of conversations where people are talking about cool things they've built, abstract things they've built, where they've pieced together a bunch of tools to come up with something interesting, or they've growth-hacked something.

### Your Unique Angle

61. What do you know or have experienced that most people in the AI/productivity space haven't?

62. What perspective do you bring that's different from others building in this space?

63. What would make someone follow you specifically vs. the dozens of other founders posting?

What do you know or have experienced that most people in the AI productivity space haven't? Um, I've done Scott Sniper stuff, which is all about planning missions and going on missions and that's intense. I've won a few hackathons, and so I really feel like I know how to build. Um, I think people in AI are just trying to get too intellectual with AI versus me. I'm just trying to leverage AI and make it useful, make it my thought partner, help me help clarify my thinking. So that I can do more rather than figure out this secret answer that no one's thought about. Like, I'm more about piecing it together to make it useful rather than coming at it from a position of I have the answer. Um, what perspective do I bring that's different from others building in the space? I'm more sort of blue collar with software engineering where it's like I tinker, I work, I build, and I get it working for me. And I think through trial and error, I find a system that kind of works. Um, I think people would want to follow me because they're curious about what I'm building and the kind of energy I bring to what I'm building. I don't know, something like that.

Okay, the biggest myth about productivity is that you're not going to get that much more productive by timeboxing yourself to things. You really are going to get more productive when you have clarity of thought. The biggest myth about AI is that being smart and knowledge acquisition is the big thing. Knowledge acquisition is the piece. You want AI to be smart, and it really is smart, but it's more in the systems you build around it, the context you build around it that will make it powerful. I started BuildOS because I wanted to build on all of my ideas, and I wanted to be organized with my ideas and be able to find them and build off of them when the time's ready. I needed to place a store of my ideas and projects and build on them, and I wanted an AI assistant to help me clarify my thinking and stuff like that. BuildOS is for people who build, who are ambitious. The thing I wish I knew before I started building is that there's going to be a lot of trial and error. You want to set yourself up for maximum iteration and talk to users sooner rather than later. The best advice I've gotten is an MVP isn't necessarily the thing anymore. You can't have something bare bones that you push out. You have to have something that is actually useful that you push out, and that actually requires more effort. The best advice I've gotten is ... I don't even know. In five years, BuildOS will be helping out a ton of people. In five years, AI productivities will be more based around frameworks. The thing that makes me different from other founders is ... my humble, grindy attitude. I don't know.
