## 🔥 Hot Take Thread Template

### 1️⃣ Provocative Hook

- Lead with a **strong claim or contrarian statement**.
  _Examples:_
    - “Remote work isn’t the future—it’s already outdated.”
    - “90% of ‘AI productivity hacks’ are a waste of time.”

### 2️⃣ Stakes / Why It Matters

- One tweet explaining the status quo most people believe.
- One tweet stating the cost of that belief.

### 3️⃣ Evidence & Reasoning

- 3–5 tweets breaking down _why you think the consensus is wrong_:
    - Data points or quick stats
    - Anecdotes or personal experience
    - A clear logical chain (“If X is true, then Y must follow.”)

### 4️⃣ Counter-examples or Rebuttals

- Briefly acknowledge obvious pushback: “Some will argue X, but here’s why that misses the point…”

### 5️⃣ Call to Reflection / Engagement

- End with an open question or challenge:
    - “What’s one example that proves me wrong?”
    - “Are you still betting on remote-first?”

### Pro Tips for Both

- **Short sentences & white space**: makes each tweet skimmable.
- **Visuals**: charts, screenshots, or simple graphics lift engagement.
- **One idea per tweet**: don’t cram.

You can keep these as reusable checklists so every time you draft, you’re just filling in the blanks instead of reinventing the structure.
