## Post 1: The Linear Frustration (Pillar 1 - Context Engineering)

**Recommended:** Week 1, Tuesday

```
At my last job, my manager wanted Linear kept up to date with progress.

My reaction: "Just look at my pull requests. This is such a hassle."

Linear wasn't helping me with my project.
It was only helping managers.

That's when I realized something:

Most project management tools are for managers, not makers.

What I actually wanted:
→ A thought partner that updates as I talk to it
→ Something that helps ME think, not just reports up
→ Context that builds over time

That's what I'm building at BuildOS.

If you've ever felt like PM tools slow you down more than help, I'd love to hear your story.
```

**Why this works:**

- Real story from your Curri experience
- Contrarian take on PM tools
- Opens conversation with question at end
- Positions BuildOS without being promotional

## Post 2: What I Was Wrong About (Pillar 2 - Building in Public)

**Recommended:** Week 1, Thursday

```
Here's what I was wrong about when building BuildOS:

I loved the brain dump feature.
Users could just dump thoughts, AI would organize them.

But I should have gotten to agentic chat sooner.

Brain dumping is great—but the agent should talk back.
The agent knows shit too.

The pivot: Not just projects/tasks/calendars.
Projects with defined goals, documents, milestones, plans.

The system should help you get to the end state:
"Here's the goal. Here are milestones. Here's the plan. Here are tasks. Go step by step."

Speaking from experience, not authority here. This stuff is too new.

What are you learning as you build?
```

**Why this works:**

- Vulnerability about being wrong
- Shows product evolution (social proof of learning)
- "Learning voice, not authoritative" positioning
- Ends with engagement question

---

## Post 3: The Context Problem (Pillar 3 - AI Productivity)

**Recommended:** Week 2, Tuesday

```
The context problem nobody talks about:

I kept pasting documents into ChatGPT.
Same context. Different chats.
Over and over.

ChatGPT knows about me.
But I don't know what it knows.

I wanted transparency:
"What does it know about me? Let me fill in the gaps."

I wanted a system that knows where to look.

This is context engineering.

It's not about prompts.
It's about: How do you pull in relevant information strategically?
With all the data possible, what's actually relevant to what you're trying to do?

If you want the AI agent to be good, you've got to give it the right context.

That's the core insight.
```

**Why this works:**

- Real problem you experienced
- Introduces "context engineering" positioning
- Not preachy - sharing insight
- Establishes thought leadership naturally

## Post 4: Your Second Brain is a Graveyard (Pillar 4 - Contrarian)

**Recommended:** Week 2, Thursday

```
Your second brain is a graveyard.

I have tons of stale notes in Obsidian.
Static. High maintenance to organize.
Never going back to them.

Same problem with Apple Notes.
Tons of notes. No organization.

Notion? Too complicated.
Moleskines? Physical, no AI.

Here's what I actually wanted:

A thing I could just talk to.
And it understands where I'm coming from.

Not a database I have to maintain.
A conversation I keep coming back to.

That's the difference.
```

**Why this works:**

- Contrarian take that resonates
- Real productivity journey (not made up)
- Sets up the BuildOS value prop without selling
- Hook is polarizing (in a good way)

## Post 5: Intelligent Tool Use (Pillar 1 - Context Engineering)

**Recommended:** Week 3, Tuesday

```
MCPs and tool use are hot right now.

Here's what I'm learning:

You're not going to throw all the tools at AI and have it do a great job.
You need to give it the specific tools for the job.
Otherwise, the rest is noise.

I was connecting Uber, Lyft, DoorDash APIs at Curri.
Algorithm searched drivers based on search radius, price, time spent searching.
If criteria not met → fall back to next option.

This is "intelligent tool use"—and I was doing it before AI made it trendy.

The insight: It's not about how many tools you have.
It's about selecting the right tool for the context.

Same applies to AI agents.
```

**Why this works:**

- Technical credibility from Curri experience
- Contrarian take on hot topic (MCPs)
- "Learning" voice, not preachy
- Shows you've been thinking about this before it was trending

## Post 6: The Grind (Pillar 2 - Building in Public)

**Recommended:** Week 3, Thursday

```
What keeps me up at night:

"Is BuildOS solving a real problem?"

It's solving it for me.
But explaining it to others is hard.
Differentiating from ChatGPT and Claude is hard.

What I love about it:
It's building context. That part is really powerful.

~70 signups. Few beta users. No active users yet.

I'm not pretending this is a rocketship.
I'm sharing the grind.

There's going to be a lot of trial and error.
Set yourself up for maximum iteration.
Talk to users sooner rather than later.

Anyone else in the "it works for me but how do I explain it?" phase?
```

**Why this works:**

- Radical transparency (real numbers)
- Relatable founder struggle
- Not fake positivity
- Ends with community question

---

## Post 7: Clarity Over Time (Pillar 3 - AI Productivity)

**Recommended:** Week 4, Tuesday

```
People are focused on tools.

They should be focused on building context about the user and their goals.

Context engineering = the information relevant to the task at hand.

It's not "feed AI everything."
It's "feed AI what matters for THIS moment."

You don't get more productive by budgeting time better.
You get more productive by getting clarity.

People are already doing their best.
They just need more clarity to be more productive.

If you get people thinking clearly, they'll be more productive.

That's the bet I'm making with BuildOS.
```

**Why this works:**

- Core philosophy clearly stated
- Contrarian take on productivity
- Positions context engineering concept
- Connects to BuildOS mission

## Post 8: Blue Collar Software Engineering (Pillar 4 - Contrarian)

**Recommended:** Week 4, Thursday

```
Biggest productivity myth:

"Timeboxing makes you more productive."

No. Clarity of thought makes you more productive.

Biggest AI myth:

"Being smart/knowledge acquisition is the thing."

No. Systems and context around AI make it powerful.

Most productivity tools and project management apps slow you down.
You spend all your time organizing information and not executing.

I tinker. I work. I build. I get it working for me.
Through trial and error, I find a system that works.

Blue collar software engineering.

Not "I have the answer."
Just "piecing it together to make it useful."
```

**Why this works:**

- Introduces your unique positioning
- Contrarian takes on common myths
- Authentic voice
- Differentiates from "thought leader" types

## Bonus: Marine Corps Angle (Use Sparingly)

**Save for occasional use - not the main identity**

```
Before I wrote code, I was a scout sniper in the Marines.

What does that have to do with building software?

More than you'd think:

→ Five-paragraph order planning (reconnaissance requires heavy planning)
→ Long-range precision requires methodical approach
→ Stalking requires patience and concentration
→ Concentration for long periods → translates to programming

I didn't learn to code in school.
I failed a programming class in community college before joining the Marines.

Then I read Tim Ferriss: "If you want to succeed as entrepreneur, you need to be technical or you're at the mercy of whoever is technical."

So I went to a coding bootcamp. And it clicked.

Background colors the work. It doesn't define it.
```

**Why this works:**

- Uses sparingly as "a nice little treat"
- Connects military → coding journey
- Shows grit without making it the whole identity
- Tim Ferriss quote adds credibility
