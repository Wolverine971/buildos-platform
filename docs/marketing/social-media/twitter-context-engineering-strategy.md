# Twitter Context Engineering Leadership Strategy

**Account: @djwayne3**  
**Focus: Establishing thought leadership in Context Engineering**  
**Created:** 2025-09-02

## 🎯 Strategic Positioning

### Core Message

Position as THE authority on context engineering and AI memory problems without revealing BuildOS's proprietary implementation details.

### The "Show, Don't Tell" Strategy

Instead of revealing WHY BuildOS wins, demonstrate the PROBLEMS that context engineering solves.

---

## 📝 Content Pillars & Distribution

### 1. Context Loss Horror Stories (30%)

- [x] "Just spent 30 mins explaining my project to ChatGPT... again"
- "Day 47 of teaching my AI assistant what we discussed yesterday"
- "That feeling when your AI forgets everything after 8k tokens"
- Share memes about AI amnesia
- Document real frustrations with current tools

### 2. Lack of context problems

- The reason why bill nye the science guy cannot give you great marital advice to save your marriage is because he has been in a classroom and on tv talking about gravity and biology his whole life. If he studied marriage relationships his whole life then he could problably give you some great tips. The context matters. And the context matters with AI and llms. THe llms are smart

### 2. Context Engineering Tips (25%)

- "Context tip: Structure your prompts like [share technique without revealing secret sauce]"
- "Most people prompt wrong. They dump everything. Smart people build context layers"
- "The difference between a 10x and 1x AI user? Context management"
- Mini-threads on context patterns you've discovered
- General principles without implementation details

### 3. Philosophical Takes on AI Memory (20%)

- "We're teaching AI to be smart but not how to remember"
- "The next breakthrough isn't better models, it's better memory"
- "Context is the moat nobody's talking about"
- Challenge popular opinions about AI agents
- Contrarian takes on the AI hype cycle

### 4. Live Context Experiments (15%)

- "Testing how long it takes for [AI tool] to lose context. Starting now..."
- "Context degradation experiment, hour 3..."
- Document failures of other tools (without being negative)
- A/B test different context approaches publicly
- Time-lapse threads showing context decay

### 5. BuildOS Teasers (10%)

- "Working on something that remembers... everything"
- "What if your AI never forgot your project details?"
- Progress updates without revealing the how
- User testimonials about "finally having context"
- Vague but exciting milestone announcements

## 🔥 Sample Tweet Templates

### Hook + Problem + Tease

```
Everyone's obsessed with smarter AI.
I'm obsessed with AI that remembers.

Here's why context > intelligence:
[thread without revealing implementation]
```

### Contrarian Take

```
Unpopular opinion:
GPT-5 won't matter if it still forgets what you told it 10 messages ago.

The context problem is bigger than the intelligence problem.
```

### Teaching Without Revealing

```
Context Engineering 101:
- Layer your information
- Build semantic anchors
- Create memory triggers
- [general principle, not your specific method]

Most people just dump text and pray.
```

### Problem Agitation

```
You: *explains entire project to AI*
AI: "Got it!"
You: *asks follow-up question*
AI: "I don't have any context about your project"

This is why we can't have nice things.
```

### Vision Casting

```
Imagine an AI that never forgets:
- Your project goals
- Your coding style
- Your business context
- Your previous decisions

That's the future I'm building toward.
```
