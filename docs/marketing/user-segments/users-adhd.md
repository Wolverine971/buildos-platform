# User Segment Messaging - ADHD Users

## Core Understanding

**Their Reality:** Traditional productivity tools are built for neurotypical brains. ADHD users don't need more features - they need different approaches.

**Our Message:** BuildOS is built BY someone with ADHD, FOR people with ADHD. We get it because we live it.

## Primary Messaging

### Hero Headline Options

1. **"Finally, a productivity tool that thinks like you do"**
2. **"Built for minds that move fast"**
3. **"Your ADHD brain isn't broken. Your tools are."**
4. **"Stop fighting your brain. Start working with it."**

### Value Proposition for ADHD

"BuildOS works with your scattered thoughts, not against them. Just dump everything from your brain - voice, text, whatever feels right. Our AI understands ADHD thought patterns and organizes them into clear projects with tiny, doable next steps. No complex systems to maintain. No shame when you abandon it. Just a home base that's always there when you need it."

## Emotional Journey Messaging

### The Problem (They Feel This)

"You've tried Notion. And Todoist. And bullet journals. And that color-coded system your friend swears by.

They all worked... for about 3 days.

Now you have 47 abandoned productivity apps and feel worse than when you started.

You're not lazy. You're not broken. You just need different tools."

### The Solution (We Provide This)

"BuildOS doesn't ask you to change how your brain works.

Brain dump when you're overwhelmed. Get clear next steps. Schedule them with one click. That's it.

No setup. No maintenance. No 47-step workflows.

Just clarity when you need it."

### The Outcome (They Achieve This)

"Imagine actually finishing projects. Remembering important tasks. Feeling on top of your life instead of drowning in it.

That's not a fantasy. That's just Tuesday with BuildOS."

## Channel-Specific Messaging

### Email Campaigns

**Subject Lines:**

- "Your ADHD brain is not the problem"
- "I abandoned Notion 6 times too"
- "From chaos to clarity (in under 60 seconds)"
- "The productivity tool that doesn't judge your 2am brain dumps"
- "Built by someone with ADHD who gets it"

**Email Body Template:**

```
Hey [Name],

Real talk: How many productivity apps have you abandoned this year?

I'm guessing at least 3. Maybe 10.

Here's why they don't work for ADHD brains:
- Too many decisions to make
- Too much setup required
- Too much maintenance needed
- Too much shame when you inevitably abandon them

BuildOS is different.

Dump your thoughts. See them organized. Pick one thing to do.

That's it. That's the whole system.

Built by someone with ADHD who was tired of pretending Notion would save them.

[Try BuildOS free - no 47-step setup required]

P.S. You can literally just voice record your chaos and we'll handle the rest.
```

### Social Media Posts

**Twitter/X:**
"ADHD productivity hack: Stop trying to use neurotypical tools.

You don't need more features.
You don't need more discipline.
You don't need more shame.

You need tools built for how YOUR brain works.

That's why I built BuildOS."

**Instagram:**
[Image: Messy desk with multiple notebooks]
"POV: You bought another planner thinking THIS TIME it'll work

Spoiler: It won't.

Your ADHD brain doesn't need more systems. It needs the RIGHT system.

BuildOS: Dump thoughts → Get clarity → Actually do things

Built by someone with ADHD who tried all the planners too 🧠"

**TikTok Hook:**
"If you have ADHD and have abandoned Notion at least twice, this is for you..."

**Pain Point Section:**

```
Sound Familiar?

✓ Started 15 different organization systems this year
✓ Have the "Notion graveyard" of abandoned workspaces
✓ Bought planners you used for exactly 3 days
✓ Feel shame about your "productivity attempts" folder
✓ Know exactly what you need to do but can't start

You're not alone. 89% of ADHD adults abandon traditional productivity tools within 2 weeks.

BuildOS is different.
```

### Reddit Community Posts

**r/ADHD:**
"I built a productivity tool specifically for ADHD brains (because I have ADHD and nothing else worked)"

"Not here to spam, but I genuinely built this because I was tired of:

- Abandoning Notion after 3 days
- Feeling stupid when 'simple' systems felt impossible
- The shame spiral of failed productivity attempts

BuildOS just lets you brain dump and handles the organization. No setup, no maintenance, just dump and go.

Happy to answer questions about building tools for our brains!"

## Objection Handling

### "I've tried everything, nothing works"

"Same. That's literally why I built this. Other tools ask you to change. BuildOS changes for you. Just try brain dumping once - if it doesn't click, you've lost 60 seconds."

### "It's probably too complicated"

"It's literally: talk/type your thoughts, see them organized, pick what to do. If you can send a voice message, you can use BuildOS."

### "I'll just abandon this too"

"Maybe. But our users with ADHD have a 77% retention rate after 30 days. That's because there's nothing to maintain. No system to keep up. Just dump thoughts when overwhelmed."

### "I can't afford another subscription"

"How much have you spent on planners, apps, and systems you've abandoned? BuildOS is $15/month. That's less than the notebook you'll use for 3 days."
