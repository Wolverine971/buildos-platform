## Pitch Template

### Subject Line Options

1. "ADHD founder builds AI productivity tool - guest pitch"
2. "From Marine to ADHD productivity founder - guest story"
3. "Context Engineering: A new approach to ADHD productivity"

### Core Pitch

> Hi [Name],
>
> I'm DJ, founder of BuildOS - an AI-powered productivity tool I built specifically because traditional tools kept failing my ADHD brain.
>
> Quick background: I served in the Marines (external structure = I thrived), then became an engineer at a $100M startup building complex systems. But I couldn't keep my personal life organized. Every productivity tool I tried worked for 3 days then joined my graveyard of abandoned apps.
>
> So I built BuildOS with a different philosophy: AI maintains the structure FOR you. You just dump your scattered thoughts, and the AI organizes them into projects and next steps. No complex setup. No shame when you abandon it for a week.
>
> I call this approach "Context Engineering" - giving AI enough context about your life that it can actually help, instead of generic advice.
>
> I'd love to share this story with your audience:
>
> - The paradox of Marine discipline + ADHD chaos
> - Why traditional productivity tools fail ADHD minds
> - How AI can be the external executive function we need
>
> Happy to tailor the conversation to what resonates with your listeners.
>
> DJ Wayne
> BuildOS.app
