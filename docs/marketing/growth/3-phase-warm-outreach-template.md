## **3-Phase Warm Outreach Template**

### **Phase 1: Build Trust (Common Ground)**

- Trust is coorelated with predictability
- Find authentic shared experiences/interests
- Reference specific details that show genuine familiarity
- Keep it warm and conversational, not networking-y

### **Phase 2: Emotional Labeling (Meeting Them Where They Are)**

**Research Sources:**

- Recent social posts (energy, tone, what they're celebrating or processing)
- Interviews/podcasts (what lit them up, what they lingered on)
- Recent moves/decisions (the emotional labor behind them)
- Industry/world context (collective exhaustion, excitement, uncertainty)
- Seasonal/life timing (transitions, anniversaries, milestones)

**Gentle Label Examples:**

- "I imagine you might be feeling both excited and a bit overwhelmed with..."
- "It seems like you're in that beautiful but exhausting phase of..."
- "I've been noticing you're really pouring yourself into..."
- "Feels like you might be craving some space to process everything after..."

### **Phase 3: Open-Ended Next Steps (Their Choice)**

**The Options Approach:**
"If any of this resonates, I'd love to [be helpful/connect/share]. Maybe that looks like:

- Just having a casual coffee chat to brainstorm
- Me sharing some resources that helped me with something similar
- Introducing you to [specific person] who navigated this well
- Or something else entirely that would feel supportive to you right now

No pressure at all - I know how full life gets. Just wanted to reach out human to human."

**Key Elements:**

- Multiple genuinely helpful options
- Include a "or something else" option
- Acknowledge their autonomy
- End with warmth, not expectation

This feels like connection, not transaction. Would you like me to draft a complete example using this template?
