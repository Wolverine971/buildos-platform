# Integrations Hub

Centralized references for shared third-party integrations used across the BuildOS platform.

- [Stripe](./stripe/README.md) � Billing, subscriptions, webhook operations
- [Twilio / SMS](./twilio/README.md) � Messaging service configuration and runbooks

Add new integration docs as subdirectories here so they appear in the root documentation navigation.
