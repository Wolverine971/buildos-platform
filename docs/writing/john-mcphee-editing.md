Here’s a holistic, end-to-end process for making a blog post that’s beautiful, genuinely useful, and conversion-ready. It blends McPhee’s structure-first approach with modern UX, SEO, and CRO.

# 1) Strategy & Brief (before you write)

**Goal:** align the idea, audience, and CTA.

- **Audience + Job to be Done:** who’s reading, what problem they’re solving today.
- **1-sentence promise:** “After this, you’ll be able to \_\_\_.”
- **Primary CTA:** one action (subscribe, demo, download). Make it the _natural next step_.
- **Content angle:** what’s contrarian or uniquely practical here?
- **Proof sources:** data, case studies, anecdotes, expert quotes.
- **Success metric:** scroll depth, CTA click-thru, time on page, email signups.

**Quick brief template (fill this in):**
Title • Promise • Reader JTBD • Primary CTA • Secondary path (next post) • Structure choice • 5–7 beats • Examples/Proof • Visuals plan • Target keywords • Must-link internal pages

# 2) Structure First (McPhee mode)

**Goal:** make the bones strong and invisible.

- Pick an **ordering principle:** problem→cause→solution; chronological; thematic; field-notes→pattern→playbook; Q\&A.
- Draft a **beat outline** (H2/H3s) with each section’s _function_.
- **Lead**: hook + promise + roadmap within the first 150 words.
- Ensure a **through-line:** one question the whole post answers.
- Map **transitions** (why this section follows the last).

# 3) Draft for Substance (not style yet)

**Goal:** deliver value early and often.

- **Time to value:** give a quick win (TL;DR, checklist, or summary) above the fold.
- Use **specifics**: numbers, mini-stories, screenshots, scripts.
- Keep one **voice** and POV; avoid hedging.
- Add **open loops** you’ll close later (tease the payoff).

# 4) Two Editing Passes

**Macro (structure) – McPhee:**

- Tighten the lead; verify the through-line.
- Merge/split/reorder sections so the structure “disappears.”
- Ensure each section resolves some tension.

**Micro (language) – McPhee:**

- **Box words**: mark vague/cliché bits → replace via dictionary precision.
- **Greening**: remove 10–20% without leaving a seam.
- Rhythm: vary sentence lengths; front-load important clauses.
- Kill filler: “very,” “really,” “in order to,” “basically.”

# 5) UX for Readability & Flow

**Goal:** scannable, friendly, and visually inviting.

- **Subheads** every ≤200 words, descriptive (promise what’s below).
- **Paragraphs**: 2–5 sentences; generous white space.
- **Lists, callouts, pull-quotes** for emphasis.
- **Visuals**: 1 hero + 1 diagram per major concept; annotate if helpful.
- **Table of contents** if >1200 words; show **read time**.
- **Accessibility**: proper H1→H2→H3 hierarchy, alt text, good contrast.

# 6) Conversion Design (CRO)

**Goal:** make the next step obvious and low-friction.

- **CTA placement**: above the fold, mid-post (contextual), end-post.
- **CTA copy**: action + outcome (“Get the worksheet,” “See examples”).
- **Lead magnet** that matches the post (template, checklist, script).
- **Micro-CTAs** to explore: inline links to key concepts, related posts, and product pages that _extend_ the topic.
- **Internal link pattern**: 2–3 internal links per 500 words; 1 authoritative external per 800 words.

# 7) SEO & Discoverability (without killing voice)

- Match **search intent** (informational vs. commercial).
- **Title** 50–60 chars; **meta description** 140–160 chars with the promise.
- **Slug** short and human.
- Use **synonyms/variants** naturally in H2s/body.
- **Schema**: Article + Breadcrumb; FAQ if you include Q\&A.
- **Open Graph**: custom image, clear headline.

# 8) Performance Polishing

- Compress images; lazy-load below the fold.
- Avoid render-blocking junk.
- Mobile first; test tap targets and line length.

# 9) Instrumentation & Feedback Loops

- Track **scroll depth (25/50/75/90%)**, **CTA clicks**, **TOC interactions**, **copy events** (people copying scripts), **outbound link clicks**.
- Watch **time on page** and **returning visitors**.
- **A/B test** headlines, leads, and CTA copy/placement.
- Add a **reader prompt** at the end (“What was missing?”) and a 1-click poll.

# 10) Distribution & Upcycling

- Create **3–5 social snippets** (quote, stat, hook) + a thread outline.
- Send a **brief newsletter**: promise → key takeaway → CTA.
- Repurpose into **slides, short video, or checklist PDF** (your lead magnet).
- Cross-link into **hub/spoke** clusters so readers explore more.

# 11) Update & Governance

- Schedule **refreshes** (90–180 days): verify facts, add examples, update screenshots.
- Log changes; keep the canonical URL; note “Last updated” at top.
- Maintain a **content map**: topics, CTAs, performance.

## Quality Bar (quick checklist)

- Lead hooks + states the promise within **150 words**.
- One clear **through-line**; every section advances it.
- **10–20% trimmed** via greening; no seams.
- **Subheads** every ≤200 words; descriptive, not clever.
- **Actionable specifics** (numbers, scripts, examples).
- **3 CTAs** (top/mid/bottom) with outcome-oriented copy.
- **2–3 internal links / 500 words**; **1 authoritative external / 800**.
- Readability target **Grade 6–8** (without dumbing down).
- Analytics events wired; headline/CTA **A/B queued**.

## Default McPhee-aligned structure you can reuse

**Lead (hook + promise) → Stakes → Fieldwork/Examples → Pattern/Framework → How-to/Playbook → Objections/Edge cases → Payoff/Results → CTA + Next best read**
