## üìù Notes

### Current Status

- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Monorepo structure created
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Shared packages extracted
- üîÑ Phase 3: Deployment and CI/CD setup needed
- ‚è≥ Phase 4: Optimization and polish

### Important Considerations

1. **Don't delete old repos yet** - Keep them as archives for at least 3 months
2. **Test deployments thoroughly** before switching production
3. **Keep old deployment configs** as backup during transition
4. **Document everything** as you make changes

### Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev                    # Run all apps
pnpm dev --filter=@buildos/web    # Run web only
pnpm dev --filter=@buildos/worker  # Run worker only

# Building
pnpm build                  # Build everything
pnpm build --filter=@buildos/shared-types  # Build specific package

# Testing
pnpm test                   # Run all tests
pnpm test:run              # Run tests once (no watch)

# Cleaning
pnpm clean                  # Clean build artifacts
pnpm install --force        # Reinstall dependencies

# Adding dependencies
pnpm add <package> --filter=@buildos/web  # Add to specific app
pnpm add -D <package> -w    # Add dev dependency to root
```
