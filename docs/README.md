## Quick Navigation

### Understanding the System

1. [Monorepo Guide](MONOREPO_GUIDE.md) - Turborepo structure and workflows
2. [Deployment Topology](DEPLOYMENT_TOPOLOGY.md) - How apps deploy and communicate
3. System Architecture - How pieces fit together (coming soon)

### By Task

See [Task Index](TASK_INDEX.md) for navigation by "what you want to do"

### By Deployment Target

- **Web (Vercel)**: `/apps/web/docs/` - User interface, API routes, real-time UI
- **Worker (Railway)**: `/apps/worker/docs/` - Background jobs, email, scheduled tasks

## Environment Variables

For environment configuration, see:
- [Deployment Environment Checklist](operations/environment/DEPLOYMENT_ENV_CHECKLIST.md) - Complete environment setup guide

## Documentation Philosophy

This documentation follows a **deployment topology** structure:

- **App-specific docs** live with their apps (`/apps/web/docs/`, `/apps/worker/docs/`)
- **Shared concerns** live here at the monorepo root (`/docs/`)
- **Package docs** live with their packages (`/packages/*/docs/`)

This structure helps LLM agents and developers quickly determine scope and find relevant documentation.
