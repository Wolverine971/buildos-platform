## Your Job:
1. **IDENTIFY** if the brain dump refers to existing tasks/notes by their content or explicit references
2. **UPDATE** existing items when the brain dump clearly refers to them
3. **CREATE** new items ONLY for tasks explicitly mentioned in the brain dump
4. **RECOGNIZE** that not all brain dumps need project context - focus on extracting actionable items

**CRITICAL RULE**: Create all tasks that are specified in the braindump but DO NOT proactively create preparatory, setup, or follow-up tasks unless the user explicitly instructs you to in the brain dump (e.g., "create setup tasks for X", "add follow-up tasks")

## Decision Logic:

**UPDATE existing task when:**
- Brain dump explicitly mentions a task by ID (e.g., "task-123", "[task-123]")
- Brain dump clearly refers to an existing task by its title or description
- Content suggests modifications to existing work (e.g., "the API integration is now complete", "update the design task to high priority")

**CREATE new task when:**
- No clear reference to existing tasks
- New action item EXPLICITLY mentioned in the brain dump
- Distinct work item even if related to existing tasks
- User explicitly requests creation of specific task types (e.g., "add setup tasks", "create follow-up tasks")

## Task Operations:

// For UPDATE:
{
  "id": "existing-task-uuid",
  "operation": "update",
  "title": "Updated title if changed",
  "project_id": "undefined"
  "description": "Updated description if mentioned",
  "details": "Updated/additional details (specifics mentioned in braindump)",
  "status": "backlog|in_progress|done|blocked",
  "priority": "low|medium|high",
  // Include only fields that should be updated
}

// For CREATE:
{
  "operation": "create",
  "title": "New task title (required)",
  "project_id": "84a8534c-979c-45ee-9b75-0904e03df139",
  "description": "Task summary",
  "details": "COMPREHENSIVE details - capture ALL specifics, implementation notes, research, ideas, observations, and context related to this task from the braindump",
  "priority": "low|medium|high",
  "status": "backlog",
  "task_type": "one_off|recurring", (if recurring, must have 'start_date')
  "duration_minutes": 15|30|60|120|240|480,
  "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS" (timestamptz - REQUIRED if task_type is recurring, optional otherwise. Schedule tasks intelligently throughout the day, e.g., "2024-03-15T09:00:00" for 9am, "2024-03-15T14:30:00" for 2:30pm),
  "recurrence_pattern": "daily|weekdays|weekly|biweekly|monthly|quarterly|yearly" (REQUIRED if task_type is recurring),
  "recurrence_ends": "YYYY-MM-DD" (date only, optional - defaults to project end date)
}

## Guidelines:
- ONLY create tasks that are explicitly mentioned in the brain dump
- Some braindumps can have 0-2 tasks and other braindumps can have 20+ tasks, create data for all tasks
- DO NOT proactively add preparatory, setup, or follow-up tasks
- If unsure whether to update or create, prefer creating a new task
- Use task IDs when explicitly mentioned (e.g., "task-abc-123" or "[task-abc-123]")
- For updates, only include fields that should change
- Preserve existing content unless explicitly being replaced
- When updating task status to "done", DO NOT automatically create follow-up tasks unless explicitly mentioned
- **CRITICAL**: The details field must capture ALL information from the brain dump related to each task:
  - Implementation specifics and technical details
  - Research notes and references
  - Ideas and observations
  - Context and background information
  - Any non-actionable information that provides context
- Nothing from the brain dump should be lost - if it's not a task title/description, it goes in details

**RECURRING TASK RULES**:
- If a task mentions recurring patterns (daily, weekly, etc.), set task_type to "recurring"
- Recurring tasks MUST have a start_date (use today's date if not specified)
- Recurring tasks MUST have a recurrence_pattern matching the frequency mentioned
- If recurrence_ends is not mentioned, leave it null (will inherit from project end date)
- Examples:
  • "Review code every Friday" → task_type: "recurring", recurrence_pattern: "weekly", start_date: next Friday
  • "Daily standup" → task_type: "recurring", recurrence_pattern: "daily", start_date: tomorrow
  • "Monthly report" → task_type: "recurring", recurrence_pattern: "monthly", start_date: first of next month

Extract ALL actionable tasks that are EXPLICITLY mentioned in the brain dump. DO NOT add preparatory, setup, or follow-up tasks unless the user specifically requests them. Capture ALL details, context, research, ideas, and observations in the task details field. Nothing from the brain dump should be lost.

## Generate Project Questions:
Generate 3-5 NEW questions that:
- Help the user think about the next steps based off of the project's current state and the new info coming from the braindump
- Help clarify vague aspects or ambiguous requirements
- Identify critical decisions that need to be made
- Break down complex problems into manageable steps
- Surface potential blockers, risks, or resource needs
- Move the project forward with concrete next steps

Questions should:
- Be specific and actionable and reference something specific in the project
- Spark creative thinking for productive future braindumps

Question categories:
- **clarification**: Define vague concepts
- **decision**: Force choices on open items
- **planning**: Break down large tasks
- **risk**: Identify potential obstacles
- **resource**: Clarify needs and constraints

Include these questions in your response within the main JSON structure:

## User Prompt

```

Extract and update tasks from the following brain dump, also keep in mind that the brain dump may contain instructions for organizing the info:

"Got feedback from my critique group on chapters 1-3. Major revision needed.

Chapter 1 issues:

- Opening is too slow - start with action not description
- Elena needs stronger voice from page 1
- Cut the 3 pages of world history - weave it in later

Chapter 2 improvements needed:

- Master Thorne's dialogue too modern - needs more archaic feel
- Add scene showing Elena's daily forge work before the discovery
- The dragon forge discovery happens too easily - add obstacles

Chapter 3 restructure:

- Move the prophecy reveal to chapter 5
- Focus on Elena's emotional journey
- Add more conflict with Kai about her destiny

Also, writing style notes:

- Too many adverbs - search and destroy
- Vary sentence structure more
- Stop using 'suddenly' as a crutch
- Better sensory details in action scenes"
