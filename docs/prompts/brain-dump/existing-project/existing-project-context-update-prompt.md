**PROJECT DATA:**
**PROJECT: Tidbits Capture: Social media snippets & knowledge archive** (ID: 405d060b-0469-406d-8158-e747405c7871)
Status: active | A project to capture interesting tidbits from media for social media posting and for long-term record-keeping.
Start: 2025-09-08 | End: Not set
Tags: central-planning, china, political-analysis

**Executive Summary:**
Updated context to incorporate political-analysis oriented tidbit about centralized planning and governance models; preserves existing structure and adds a new insight block for future archiving and social-media content planning.

**Context:**
### SITUATION
The user wants a project to capture and preserve interesting tidbits encountered in media for both social media posting and personal knowledge retention. The focus includes concepts discussed in media such as the YouTube channel Moon and topics like 'glowie' and 'limited hangout', with the aim of discussing these ideas publicly and maintaining an archive for reference.

### MISSION
- Build a lightweight process to identify, annotate, and store tidbits from media sources.
- Create content suitable for social media while preserving context and sources for future reference.

### EXECUTION
- APPROACH: curate tidbits from media sources (e.g., the Moon channel video 'The Moment Joe Rogan Realizes His Guest Is a Fraud') and related discussions; annotate key terms and context; tag items for searchability; generate concise post-ready notes and an archival record.
- PHASES (high-level): discovery, annotation, archiving, publishing.

### OPERATIONS
- RESOURCES: note-taking tool, cloud storage, and a simple data model (tidbit, source, date, tags, notes).
- TOOLS & TECHNIQUES: tagging, brief write-ups, and an optional publishable summary for social channels.

### COORDINATION
- STAKEHOLDERS: self (primary), potential collaborators in the future.
- DEPENDENCIES: access to source media, credibility checks, copyright considerations.

### TIMELINE
- start_date: 2025-09-08
- end_date: null

[2025-09-08] NEW INSIGHT: The brain dump introduces a political-analytical perspective on centralized planning and governance models, highlighting a contrast between China’s engineer-led, centralized planning approach and the U.S.’s lawyer-led system. It critiques the notion of a “perfect plan” and a perfectly distributed society under communism. This content is suitable for capture as a tidbit in the archive and for social-media-ready discussion; key concepts to annotate include: central planning, governance by engineers vs lawyers, communism, wealth sharing, and imperfect planning.

**OBJECTIVE**: Transform brain dump → context update operation for project 405d060b-0469-406d-8158-e747405c7871

**Context Update Criteria** (Update context when):
1. Strategic insights or learnings emerge
2. Scope or boundaries change
3. New stakeholders or dependencies identified
4. Approach or methodology evolves
5. Risks or assumptions change
6. External factors shift
7. Major decisions made

**Don't Update Context For**:
- Simple task completions
- Minor status changes
- Day-to-day progress
- Temporary blockers

**Processing Rules**:
1. Preserve ALL existing context (never delete or truncate)
2. Integrate new insights appropriately within existing structure
3. Add new sections with ## headers if needed
4. Update existing sections by appending new information
5. Add timestamps for significant updates: "Updated YYYY-MM-DD: ..."
6. Maintain markdown formatting and structure

**Context Generation (for projects)**:
Create comprehensive markdown that brings anyone up to speed. Context should integrate all non-actionable information and be organized using the following condensed framework:

1. **Situation & Environment** – Current state, pain points, relevant history, external factors, stakeholder landscape
2. **Purpose & Vision** – Core purpose, success criteria, desired future state, strategic alignment
3. **Scope & Boundaries** – Deliverables, exclusions, constraints, assumptions, key risks
4. **Approach & Execution** – Strategy, methodology, workstreams, milestones, resource plan
5. **Coordination & Control** – Governance, decision rights, communication flow, risk/issue management
6. **Knowledge & Learning** – Lessons applied, documentation practices, continuous improvement approach

**Rule:** Include in context only if the update affects these dimensions. Progress updates or short-term tasks go in `tasks` or status fields instead.

**Output Format**:
{
  "title": "Create context update summary title",
  "summary": "2-3 sentence summary of what context was updated",
  "insights": "Key insights added to the context",
  "tags": ["context", "update"],
  "metadata": {
    "processingNote": "Context-only update for 405d060b-0469-406d-8158-e747405c7871"
