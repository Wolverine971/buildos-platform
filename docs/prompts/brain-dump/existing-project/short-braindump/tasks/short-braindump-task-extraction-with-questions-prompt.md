**Executive Summary:**
Outreach project aimed at engaging influential individuals to gather insights and promote the BuildOS tool.

**Context:**
##### Situation & Environment

BuildOS is an AI-first project organization tool designed to help users organize their information through voice interaction. The goal is to reach out to influential individuals who can provide feedback and help promote the tool.

##### Purpose & Vision

The purpose of this project is to engage with potential users who can leverage BuildOS for their needs and provide insights on its functionality. Success will be measured by the engagement and feedback received from these individuals.

##### Scope & Boundaries

Deliverables include outreach to selected individuals and gathering their insights. Exclusions include any marketing campaigns outside of direct outreach.

##### Approach & Execution

The strategy involves identifying key individuals and reaching out to them to discuss their experiences and how BuildOS could benefit them. Milestones include initial contact and follow-up discussions.

## Primary Job: Extract Tasks
1. **IDENTIFY** all actionable items EXPLICITLY mentioned in the braindump
2. **CREATE** tasks ONLY for items directly stated - DO NOT add preparatory or follow-up tasks
3. **ANALYZE** if displayed questions were answered
4. **DETERMINE** if project context needs updating based on decision matrix

**CRITICAL RULES**:
- Extract ONLY tasks that are explicitly mentioned
- DO NOT proactively create setup, preparatory, or follow-up tasks
- DO NOT fill gaps or add "missing" tasks
- ONLY exception: If user explicitly says "create setup tasks" or "add follow-up tasks"
- Consider existing tasks to avoid duplicates and understand project context

**Context Update Criteria** (Update context when):
1. Strategic insights or learnings emerge
2. Scope or boundaries change
3. New stakeholders or dependencies identified
4. Approach or methodology evolves
5. Risks or assumptions change
6. External factors shift
7. Major decisions made
8. **Project structure needs evolution** (add new sections, reorganize existing ones to better communicate the project's story)

**Don't Update Context For**:
- Simple task completions
- Minor status changes
- Day-to-day progress
- Temporary blockers

**Remember**: Context structure should evolve with the project. Don't be constrained by the initial framework - adapt it as the project's needs become clearer.

Otherwise, treat it as task-level updates only.

## Task Model:
tasks: {
  title: string (required, max 255),
  project_id: "16ce04af-b85f-4f9b-9702-dbdad2659f9b" (required),
  description: string,
  details: string (specifics mentioned in braindump),
  status: "backlog"|"in_progress"|"done"|"blocked",
  priority: "low"|"medium"|"high",
  task_type: "one_off"|"recurring",
  duration_minutes?: number,
  start_date?: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS" (timestamptz - parse dates AND times, intelligently order tasks throughout the day e.g. "2024-03-15T09:00:00" for 9am, "2024-03-15T14:30:00" for 2:30pm, REQUIRED if task_type is "recurring"),
  recurrence_pattern?: "daily"|"weekdays"|"weekly"|"biweekly"|"monthly"|"quarterly"|"yearly" (REQUIRED if task_type is "recurring"),
  recurrence_ends?: "YYYY-MM-DD" (date only - parse from braindump or defaults to project end date if not specified),
  dependencies?: string[],
  parent_task_id?: string
}

## Date Parsing:
- "next week" → start_date: next Monday (calculate actual date)
   - "30 days" → end_date: 30 days from start_date (calculate actual date)
   - "3 months" → end_date: 3 months from start_date (calculate actual date)
   - "by end of month" → end_date: last day of current month
   - "in 2 weeks" → start_date: 2 weeks from today
   - "next Monday" → specific date of next Monday
   - "starting tomorrow" → start_date: tomorrow's date
   - "due Friday" → end_date: this Friday's date
   - "by Christmas" → end_date: 2025-12-25
   - "Q1" → end_date: March 31st of current year
   - "Q2" → end_date: June 30th of current year
   - Always calculate actual YYYY-MM-DD dates, NEVER use relative terms
   - If no timeline mentioned, use start_date: today, end_date: null
   - Current date context: Today is 2025-09-27

**RECURRING TASK RULES**:
- If a task mentions recurring patterns (daily, weekly, etc.), set task_type to "recurring"
- Recurring tasks MUST have a start_date (use today's date if not specified)
- Recurring tasks MUST have a recurrence_pattern matching the frequency mentioned
- If recurrence_ends is not mentioned, leave it null (will inherit from project end date)
- Examples:
  • "Review code every Friday" → task_type: "recurring", recurrence_pattern: "weekly", start_date: next Friday
  • "Daily standup" → task_type: "recurring", recurrence_pattern: "daily", start_date: tomorrow
  • "Monthly report" → task_type: "recurring", recurrence_pattern: "monthly", start_date: first of next month

## Questions to Analyze:
- Question fb87e262-8c79-49d4-a849-fb3aa68674c7: "What is the best method to approach Brian Singerman and Tim Hissa for outreach?"
- Question ed86e5e2-a094-4353-a5bd-1c95236eda2d: "What potential blockers might arise during the outreach process?"
- Question 4c6ebf8c-a1cf-4247-b100-89241d6cbae5: "What specific features of BuildOS would be most appealing to each individual?"

Determine if each question was addressed in the braindump.
Include in your response:
"questionAnalysis": {
  "[questionId]": {
    "wasAnswered": boolean,
    "answerContent": "extracted answer if addressed, null otherwise"
  }
}

## Generate Project Questions:
Generate 3-5 NEW questions that:
- Help the user think about the next steps based off of the project's current state and the new info coming from the braindump
- Help clarify vague aspects or ambiguous requirements
- Identify critical decisions that need to be made
- Break down complex problems into manageable steps
- Surface potential blockers, risks, or resource needs
- Move the project forward with concrete next steps

Questions should:
- Be specific and actionable and reference something specific in the project
- Spark creative thinking for productive future braindumps

Question categories:
- **clarification**: Define vague concepts
- **decision**: Force choices on open items
- **planning**: Break down large tasks
- **risk**: Identify potential obstacles
- **resource**: Clarify needs and constraints

Generate 3-5 NEW questions that help move the project forward based on the current state and new information from this braindump.

## Output JSON:
{
  "tasks": [
    // Array of task objects to create
  ],
  "requiresContextUpdate": boolean,
  "contextUpdateReason": "Which decision matrix criteria triggered update need (or null)",
  "questionAnalysis": {
    "[questionId]": {
      "wasAnswered": boolean,
      "answerContent": "extracted answer or null"
    }
  },
  "projectQuestions": [
    {
      "question": "specific question text",
      "category": "clarification|decision|planning|risk|resource",
      "priority": "high|medium|low",
      "context": "why this matters now",
      "expectedOutcome": "what info this should produce"
    }
  ]
}

Focus on extracting actionable items. Only flag for context update if the braindump contains strategic changes matching the decision matrix.
