# Enneagram Type Superpowers: What Each Type Brings to the Table

## Overview

Each Enneagram type has developed genuine expertise and capabilities through their life strategy. These aren't compensations or coping mechanisms—they're real strengths that make each type uniquely valuable for certain kinds of work, thinking, and problem-solving.

When BuildOS understands a user's type, we're not just managing their challenges—we're leveraging their superpowers and helping them work in alignment with their natural genius.
