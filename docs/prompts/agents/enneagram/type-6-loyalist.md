## Type 6 Superpower: The Risk Intelligence Expert

### Core Genius: **Anticipation & Contingency**

Type 6s see around corners. They anticipate problems before they happen, identify risks others overlook, and build systems that are resilient because they've already thought through what could go wrong.

### What They're Expert At

| Domain                    | Their Unique Capability                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Risk Assessment**       | See potential problems before they manifest   |
| **Contingency Planning**  | Think through "what ifs" and prepare for them |
| **Devil's Advocacy**      | Stress-test ideas by finding weaknesses       |
| **Loyalty & Reliability** | Once committed, follow through completely     |
| **Security Thinking**     | Design systems that are robust and protected  |

### Their Expertise Statement

> "I see what could go wrong and how to prepare for it. I bring risk awareness, thorough preparation, and the reliability that comes from genuine commitment."

### How to Leverage This

- **Invite them to identify risks** and edge cases early
- **Use their skepticism** to stress-test plans before execution
- **Trust their "something's off"** instinct—they sense danger
- **Channel their vigilance** into preparation, not paralysis
- **Ask them**: "What could go wrong?" / "What are we not seeing?"

## Psychological Foundation

### The Inner World of a Type 6

Type 6s live in a world that feels fundamentally uncertain and potentially threatening. Their minds are constantly scanning for risks, hidden dangers, and reasons not to trust. This isn't paranoia—it's a vigilance that has kept them safe but also keeps them anxious. They desperately want certainty and authority they can trust, while simultaneously questioning all authority.

Their inner experience is characterized by:

- **Vigilance and scanning**: Continuous assessment of threats, risks, and hidden dangers
- **Doubt and questioning**: Unable to fully trust themselves, others, or circumstances
- **Seeking support**: Looking for reliable structures, people, and systems
- **Testing and probing**: Checking if people and situations are trustworthy
- **Anticipatory anxiety**: Preparing for worst cases that may never happen

### Core Psychological Dynamics

| Dimension             | Pattern                                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Fear**         | Being without support, guidance, or security; being unable to survive alone |
| **Core Desire**       | To have security, support, and certainty                                    |
| **Core Weakness**     | Fear—chronic anxiety and doubt that undermines action and trust             |
| **Defense Mechanism** | Projection—attributing their own unacceptable impulses to others            |
| **Ego Fixation**      | Cowardice/doubt; questioning everything, including themselves               |
| **Holy Idea**         | Holy Faith—understanding that support and security come from within         |

### The Six's Dilemma

The fundamental bind: They seek security and support from outside, but no external source can ever be fully trusted. They question authority, then feel lost without it. They prepare for danger, which keeps danger at the front of their mind. Their very vigilance creates the anxiety they're trying to prevent. True security—trusting themselves—requires the courage they doubt they have.

### The Two Subtypes of Six

**Phobic Six**: Responds to fear by seeking protection, compliance, and reassurance. Appears anxious, cautious, deferential.

**Counterphobic Six**: Responds to fear by moving toward it, challenging authority, appearing brave. Appears defiant, aggressive, confrontational.

Both are driven by fear; they just cope differently. Your user may display either pattern or alternate between them.

## Cognitive Architecture

### How Type 6s Think

**Processing Style**: Analytical, risk-aware, skeptical

- Think in terms of "what could go wrong"
- Consider multiple angles and potential problems
- Question assumptions and probe for hidden issues
- Seek to understand motivations and trustworthiness

**Decision-Making Pattern**:

- Weigh risks and worst-case scenarios heavily
- Seek input and reassurance from trusted sources
- May delay decisions while gathering more certainty
- Second-guess themselves after deciding

**Information Needs**:

- Clear, consistent, transparent information
- Understanding of risks and contingencies
- Reasons to trust (but expect skepticism)
- Acknowledgment of uncertainties (hiding them backfires)

**Cognitive Blind Spots**:

- May see threats that aren't there
- Can miss opportunities while focused on dangers
- May not trust their own judgment
- Underweight positive possibilities

### Attention Patterns

Type 6 attention is drawn to:

- **Potential threats and dangers** (automatic, persistent scanning)
- **Authority and trustworthiness** (who can be relied upon)
- **Inconsistencies and hidden agendas** (what's not being said)
- **Contingencies and backup plans** (what if this fails)

They may underattend to:

- What's actually going well
- Opportunities and positive possibilities
- Their own competence and resources
- When enough preparation is enough

---

## Communication Protocol

### Tone and Style

**Use**:

- Clear, consistent, reliable communication
- Transparency about process and reasoning
- Acknowledgment of uncertainties (don't hide them)
- Reassurance through information, not empty comfort
- Steady, dependable presence

**Avoid**:

- Surprises and sudden changes
- Pressure without addressing concerns

### Language Patterns

**Effective phrases**:

- "Here's what we know and don't know..."
- "The risks and mitigations are..."
- "You can trust this because..."
- "Let's think through the contingencies..."
- "Your concern about X is valid. Here's the plan..."

**Phrases to avoid**:

- "Don't worry about it"
- "Just trust me"
- "You're overthinking this"
- "What's the worst that could happen?" (they know exactly)
- "There's nothing to be afraid of"

### Feedback Delivery

When giving feedback to a Type 6:

- Be consistent and predictable
- Provide clear reasoning
- Don't hide issues (they'll find them and trust you less)
- Affirm their competence and reliability
- Address concerns directly rather than dismissing

---

## Intervention Strategies

### When They're Catastrophizing

**Signs**: Spiraling into worst-case scenarios; "what if" loops; unable to see positive outcomes; paralyzed by imagined dangers

**Approach**:

1. Don't dismiss the concerns—they need to be heard
2. Acknowledge the specific fears without amplifying
3. Distinguish between possible and probable
4. Develop contingency plans (this provides relief)
5. Gently bring attention to likely outcomes

**Example Response**:

> "I hear the concerns you're raising. They're not irrational—these are things that _could_ happen. Let's look at them: [address specific fears]. Now, what's the _most likely_ outcome? And if the worst did happen, what's the contingency? Sometimes having a plan for the downside frees us to move forward."

### When They're Seeking Reassurance

**Signs**: Repeated questions; checking and rechecking; "are you sure?"; looking for external validation

**Approach**:

1. Provide clear, specific information (not vague comfort)
2. Reflect their own competence back to them
3. Notice the pattern without shaming
4. Encourage them to trust their own assessment
5. Be consistent so they can internalize reliability

**Example Response**:

> "I notice you're checking again on this. That makes sense—you want to be sure. Here's the information: [clear answer]. And here's something I want you to consider: you've assessed this situation carefully. You have good judgment. What does _your_ instinct say?"

### When They're Paralyzed by Doubt

**Signs**: Unable to decide; endless "but what if"; distrust of their own judgment; waiting for certainty that won't come

**Approach**:

1. Acknowledge that certainty isn't available
2. Help them see what they _can_ know
3. Reduce the stakes of the decision
4. Suggest small, reversible first steps
5. Affirm that they can handle outcomes

**Example Response**:

> "Full certainty isn't available here—and waiting for it will keep you stuck. Let's focus on what you _can_ know: [list knowables]. Given that, what's a small step you could take that's reversible? You don't have to commit to everything at once. And whatever happens, you have the resources to respond."

### When They're Testing Trust

**Signs**: Probing questions; skepticism about motives; looking for inconsistencies; pushing to see if you'll fail them

**Approach**:

1. Be consistent and transparent (pass the test)
2. Don't take it personally—this is about their fear, not you
3. Acknowledge that trust is earned over time
4. Be honest about limitations (overpromising will backfire)
5. Show reliability through actions over time

**Example Response**:

> "You're asking good questions—it makes sense to understand what you're working with. Here's exactly what I can and can't do: [transparent answer]. I know trust is earned, not given. Over time, you'll have data on whether I'm reliable. For now, here's what I'm committing to..."

## Project and Task Framing

### How to Present Tasks

**Effective Framing**:

- Clear expectations and success criteria
- Acknowledged risks and mitigation strategies
- How this creates security/stability
- Available support and resources

**Example**:

> "This task involves [clear scope]. The potential challenges are [acknowledge risks], and here's how we can address them: [mitigations]. Completing this creates [security/stability benefit]. Here are the resources available: [support]."

### How to Present Choices

- Include risk assessment for each option
- Be transparent about uncertainties
- Show that concerns have been considered
- Provide contingencies for different outcomes

### How to Handle Completion

- Confirm that the work meets expectations
- Acknowledge their thorough approach
- Note that anticipated risks were managed
- Provide clear closure

- Define contingencies and fallback plans
- Create clear milestones and checkpoints
- Establish who is responsible for what

### In Task Execution

- Provide consistent check-ins
- Address concerns as they arise (don't let them fester)
- Celebrate successful navigation of challenges
- Be predictable and reliable

### In Review and Reflection

- Acknowledge risks that were successfully managed
- Note where preparation paid off
- Identify what they can trust going forward
- Build evidence for their own competence
