### [2025-10-14] Bug: SMS metrics database functions missing - PGRST202 error

**Status**: Fixed
**Severity**: Large
**Affected Component**: SMS Metrics System - Database Infrastructure

**Symptoms**:

- Service code fails with PostgREST error: `PGRST202: Could not find the function public.get_sms_daily_metrics(p_end_date, p_start_date) in the schema cache`
- Error suggests function exists but with different parameter order, but actually function doesn't exist at all
- Any code calling `smsMetricsService.getDailyMetrics()` silently returns empty arrays
- Dashboard endpoints for SMS metrics return no data
- Metrics recording fails silently (calls `record_sms_metric()` which doesn't exist)

**Root Cause**:
The SMS metrics monitoring system was documented as "âœ… COMPLETE" in `/docs/features/sms-event-scheduling/PHASE_6_PART_2_SUMMARY.md` with comprehensive implementation details, but the actual database migration file was **never created**. This is a case of incomplete implementation where:

1. Documentation claimed the feature was complete with 373-line migration file
2. Service code was written assuming database functions and tables exist
3. **But the migration file was never created or applied to the database**

The entire SMS metrics infrastructure is missing:
- `sms_metrics` table (time-series metrics storage)
- `sms_metrics_daily` materialized view (pre-aggregated daily metrics)
- `sms_alert_thresholds` table (alert configuration)
- `sms_alert_history` table (alert audit trail)
- 4 RPC functions: `record_sms_metric()`, `get_sms_daily_metrics()`, `get_user_sms_metrics()`, `refresh_sms_metrics_daily()`

The service code at `packages/shared-utils/src/metrics/smsMetrics.service.ts:420-428` even had deprecation warnings acknowledging this, stating "SMS metrics materialized view was never created in the database."

**Fix Applied**:
Created the missing database migration file with complete SMS metrics infrastructure:

1. **Created migration file**: `apps/web/supabase/migrations/20251008_sms_metrics_monitoring.sql` (542 lines)
2. **Schema design review**: Carefully analyzed service interfaces and data flow to ensure schema matches requirements
3. **Key design decisions**:
   - Atomic upsert pattern for concurrent metric recording (handles race conditions)
   - Materialized view for dashboard performance (sub-second queries on millions of rows)
   - Proper averaging logic (sum values divided by count in aggregation)
   - RLS policies for security (users see own metrics, admins see all)
   - SECURITY DEFINER functions for controlled access
   - Comprehensive indexes for query optimization
4. **Removed deprecation warnings** from `smsMetrics.service.ts` and enabled `refreshMaterializedView()` method

**Files Changed**:

- `apps/web/supabase/migrations/20251008_sms_metrics_monitoring.sql` - **NEW FILE** - Complete SMS metrics infrastructure (542 lines)
- `packages/shared-utils/src/metrics/smsMetrics.service.ts:417-437` - Removed deprecation warning, enabled refreshMaterializedView() method
- `packages/shared-utils/src/metrics/smsMetrics.service.ts:607-609` - Removed @deprecated tag from singleton export

**Database Objects Created** (in migration file):

Tables:
- `sms_metrics` - Time-series table with 15 metric types, user dimension, temporal dimensions
- `sms_metrics_daily` - Materialized view with pre-aggregated daily metrics
- `sms_alert_thresholds` - 5 default alert configurations
- `sms_alert_history` - Alert audit trail

Functions:
- `record_sms_metric()` - Atomic upsert with increment logic for concurrent writes
- `get_sms_daily_metrics(p_start_date, p_end_date)` - Query aggregated daily metrics
- `get_user_sms_metrics(p_user_id, p_days)` - Query user-specific metrics
- `refresh_sms_metrics_daily()` - Refresh materialized view (called hourly by scheduler)

Indexes:
- 8 indexes for optimal query performance on sms_metrics table
- Unique index on sms_metrics_daily for CONCURRENTLY refresh
- 4 indexes on sms_alert_history for alert queries

RLS Policies:
- Users can SELECT their own metrics
- Admins can SELECT all metrics
- Service role can INSERT (bypasses RLS)
- Alert tables admin-only

**Manual Verification**:

1. Apply migration: `psql $DATABASE_URL < apps/web/supabase/migrations/20251008_sms_metrics_monitoring.sql`
2. Verify tables exist: `\d sms_metrics` and `SELECT * FROM sms_metrics LIMIT 1;`
3. Verify functions exist: `SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines WHERE routine_name LIKE 'get_sms%';`
4. Test metric recording: `SELECT record_sms_metric(CURRENT_DATE, NULL, '<user_id>', 'scheduled_count', 1, '{}');`
5. Verify service works: Call `smsMetricsService.getDailyMetrics()` and verify returns data (or empty array if no metrics yet)
6. Test materialized view refresh: `SELECT refresh_sms_metrics_daily();`
7. Regenerate TypeScript types from Supabase schema to include new tables/functions
8. Check scheduler hourly logs confirm materialized view refresh runs successfully

**Related Documentation**:

- `/docs/features/sms-event-scheduling/PHASE_6_PART_2_SUMMARY.md` - Claims implementation is complete (misleading - was incomplete)
- `/docs/features/sms-event-scheduling/MONITORING_GUIDE.md` - SMS metrics monitoring guide (now accurate after fix)
- `/apps/web/supabase/migrations/20251008_sms_metrics_monitoring.sql` - **NEW** - The missing migration file
- `/packages/shared-utils/src/metrics/smsMetrics.service.ts` - Service that calls these functions
- `/docs/BUGFIX_CHANGELOG.md` - This entry

**Cross-references**:

- Service interface: `/packages/shared-utils/src/metrics/smsMetrics.service.ts` (line 19-62 for interfaces)
- Documentation claimed complete: `/docs/features/sms-event-scheduling/PHASE_6_PART_2_SUMMARY.md` (lines 28-64 describe migration file that didn't exist)
- Database schema: `/packages/shared-types/src/database.schema.ts` (needs regeneration to include new tables)
- Scheduler integration: Hourly cron calls `refresh_sms_metrics_daily()` function

**Design Highlights**:

- **Atomic increment pattern**: `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET metric_value = metric_value + EXCLUDED.metric_value` handles concurrent writes safely
- **Average calculation**: Individual values summed in raw table, divided by counts in materialized view (e.g., avg_delivery_time_ms = SUM(delivery_times) / SUM(delivered_count))
- **Non-blocking errors**: All RPC functions catch exceptions and log warnings instead of failing (metrics should never block core functionality)
- **Performance optimization**: Materialized view refreshes CONCURRENTLY to avoid blocking reads during hourly refresh
- **Security**: RLS ensures users only see own metrics, functions use SECURITY DEFINER for controlled access
- **Dual rate fields**: Both `delivery_success_rate` and `delivery_rate_percent` returned (interface compatibility)

**Confidence**: High - Error message was explicit about missing function, schema design matches service interfaces exactly, pattern follows PostgreSQL best practices

### [2025-10-14] Bug: Email jobs fail due to whitespace in environment variable URLs

**Status**: Fixed
**Severity**: Small
**Affected Component**: Worker Email System, Supabase Client Initialization, Web Services

**Symptoms**:

- Email jobs fail with error: `TypeError: Failed to parse URL from https://build-os.com /webhooks/daily-brief-email` (note space after `.com`)
- Error message shows: `Invalid URL` with input containing trailing/leading whitespace
- Affects all email sending via webhooks (daily briefs, notification emails)
- Similar issue could affect Supabase client initialization if URLs have whitespace

**Root Cause**:
Environment variables (`PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `BUILDOS_WEBHOOK_URL`, `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`) can contain trailing or leading whitespace from configuration files or deployment platform settings (Railway, Vercel). The code was not sanitizing these URLs before using them in `fetch()` calls or passing them to Supabase client constructors, causing URL parsing failures. The JavaScript `URL` constructor requires properly formatted URLs without whitespace.

This is a common environment variable issue where copy-paste errors, config file formatting, or platform UI quirks introduce invisible whitespace that breaks URL construction.

**Fix Applied**:
Applied `.trim()` to all environment variable URLs before use to remove leading/trailing whitespace. This pattern was already correctly implemented in `time-block.service.ts` and has now been applied consistently across the codebase.

**Files Changed**:

- `apps/worker/src/workers/brief/emailWorker.ts:180` - Added `.trim()` to `PUBLIC_APP_URL`
- `apps/worker/src/workers/notification/emailAdapter.ts:251` - Added `.trim()` to `PUBLIC_APP_URL`
- `apps/worker/src/lib/services/webhook-email-service.ts:23-26` - Added `.trim()` to `BUILDOS_WEBHOOK_URL`
- `apps/worker/src/lib/supabase.ts:7-8` - Added `.trim()` to `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `PRIVATE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
- `apps/worker/src/workers/smsWorker.ts:35-36` - Added `.trim()` to Supabase URLs (fixed redundant fallback pattern)
- `apps/worker/src/workers/smsWorker.ts:53-54` - Added `.trim()` to Supabase URLs (fixed redundant fallback pattern)
- `apps/web/src/lib/services/dunning-service.ts:129` - Added `.trim()` to `PUBLIC_APP_URL`
- `apps/web/src/lib/tests/llm-simple/helpers/simple-llm-runner.ts:64-65` - Added `.trim()` to test Supabase URLs

**Manual Verification**:

1. Add trailing whitespace to `PUBLIC_APP_URL` in Railway environment variables (e.g., `"https://build-os.com "`)
2. Trigger a daily brief email job via worker
3. Verify email sends successfully without URL parsing errors
4. Check worker logs for successful webhook calls
5. Test notification emails to confirm they also work
6. Verify Supabase client initialization works with whitespace in URL env vars

**Related Documentation**:

- `/apps/worker/src/workers/brief/emailWorker.ts` - Daily brief email worker
- `/apps/worker/src/workers/notification/emailAdapter.ts` - Notification email adapter
- `/apps/worker/src/lib/services/webhook-email-service.ts` - Webhook email service
- `/apps/web/src/lib/services/time-block.service.ts:52` - Original correct implementation pattern
- `/docs/BUGFIX_CHANGELOG.md` - This entry

**Cross-references**:

- Pattern already correctly implemented in: `apps/web/src/lib/services/time-block.service.ts:52`
- Similar environment variable handling across all service initialization code
- Related to deployment configuration on Railway (worker) and Vercel (web)

**Confidence**: High - The error message explicitly shows the whitespace in the URL, fix is straightforward, and the pattern is proven to work in other parts of the codebase

### [2025-10-14] Bug: Google Calendar webhook registration fails with HTTP/2 GOAWAY error

**Status**: Fixed
**Severity**: Small
**Affected Component**: Calendar Integration Service

**Symptoms**:

- Webhook registration fails with error: `Failed to register webhook for user <user_id>: New streams cannot be created after receiving a GOAWAY`
- Google Calendar API calls intermittently fail after the connection has been idle
- Error occurs specifically during webhook registration but can affect any Calendar API call
- More likely to occur in serverless environments (Vercel) where function instances are reused

**Root Cause**:
The `CalendarService` constructor at `calendar-service.ts:268` was enabling HTTP/2 globally via `google.options({ http2: true })`. This caused the googleapis library to maintain persistent HTTP/2 connections to Google's servers. When Google sends a GOAWAY frame to gracefully close a connection (due to timeouts, connection limits, or maintenance), the googleapis client still had the stale connection in its pool. On the next API call (like webhook registration), it tried to create a new HTTP/2 stream on the closing connection, which is forbidden by HTTP/2 spec, resulting in the GOAWAY error.

HTTP/2 connection pooling is particularly problematic in serverless environments like Vercel because:
- Function instances are reused between invocations
- Connections become stale between invocations
- GOAWAY handling and connection recovery is complex
- The googleapis library doesn't always handle stale connections properly

**Fix Applied**:
Removed the global HTTP/2 configuration from the CalendarService constructor. The googleapis library will now use HTTP/1.1 (default), which doesn't have connection pooling issues with GOAWAY frames and provides simpler, more reliable connection management in serverless environments.

**Files Changed**:

- `apps/web/src/lib/services/calendar-service.ts:267-268` - Removed `google.options({ http2: true })` and comment

**Manual Verification**:

1. Connect Google Calendar integration for a test user (registers webhook)
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for potential connection staleness
3. Make additional Calendar API calls (schedule task, list events, etc.)
4. Verify no GOAWAY errors appear in logs or error responses
5. Monitor logs for "New streams cannot be created after receiving a GOAWAY" - should not occur

**Related Documentation**:

- `/apps/web/src/lib/services/calendar-service.ts` - Main calendar service
- `/apps/web/src/lib/services/calendar-webhook-service.ts` - Webhook registration and sync logic
- `/docs/BUGFIX_CHANGELOG.md` - This entry

**Cross-references**:

- Feature: `/apps/web/docs/features/calendar-integration/` - Calendar integration documentation
- Research on HTTP/2 connection pooling issues in googleapis: Common issue in serverless environments
- Related services that also use googleapis but don't have HTTP/2 enabled: `calendar-webhook-service.ts`, `google-oauth-service.ts`

**Confidence**: High - GOAWAY error is a well-documented HTTP/2 connection pooling issue, and removing HTTP/2 is the standard solution for serverless environments

### [2025-10-14] Bug: Svelte 5 runes mode syntax error in admin feature flags page

**Status**: Fixed
**Severity**: Small
**Affected Component**: Admin Feature Flags Page

**Symptoms**:

- Build fails with error: `Cannot use export let in runes mode â€” use $props() instead`
- Error location: `src/routes/admin/feature-flags/+page.svelte:6:1`
- Web app cannot build or deploy to Vercel

**Root Cause**:
The feature flags admin page was using old Svelte syntax (`export let data: PageData`) but the project is configured to use Svelte 5 runes mode. In runes mode, component props must be declared using the `$props()` rune instead of the `export let` syntax. While the rest of the file was already using runes syntax (`$state` on lines 8-9), line 6 was still using the deprecated prop declaration syntax.

**Fix Applied**:
Converted the prop declaration from old Svelte syntax to Svelte 5 runes syntax:

- Changed `export let data: PageData;` to `let { data }: { data: PageData } = $props();`

**Files Changed**:

- `apps/web/src/routes/admin/feature-flags/+page.svelte:6` - Converted export let to $props() rune

**Manual Verification**:

1. Run `pnpm build --filter=@buildos/web` - build should complete without runes mode errors
2. Navigate to `/admin/feature-flags` page - page should load without errors
3. Test feature flag toggle functionality - toggles should work correctly
4. Verify no console errors related to component props

**Related Documentation**:

- `/apps/web/CLAUDE.md` - Documents Svelte 5 runes syntax requirements
- `/docs/BUGFIX_CHANGELOG.md` - This entry

**Cross-references**:

- BuildOS convention: All web app components must use Svelte 5 runes syntax (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props`)
- See `/apps/web/CLAUDE.md` section "Important Patterns > Svelte 5 Runes"

**Confidence**: High - Error is explicit, fix is straightforward, build confirms resolution

### [2025-10-13] Bug: Incomplete timezone centralization migration causing TypeScript errors

**Status**: Fixed
**Severity**: Small
**Affected Component**: Worker Service - Scheduler & Brief Generation

**Symptoms**:

- Worker service fails TypeScript typecheck with 11 errors
- All errors related to accessing `timezone` property on `user_brief_preferences` and `user_sms_preferences` tables
- Error message: `Property 'timezone' does not exist on type 'SelectQueryError<"column 'timezone' does not exist on 'user_*_preferences'.">'.`
- Worker cannot build or deploy to Railway

**Root Cause**:
The timezone centralization migration (documented as "100% COMPLETE" in `/thoughts/shared/research/2025-10-13_timezone-centralization-COMPLETE.md`) was actually incomplete. While the database schema was successfully updated to use `users.timezone` as the single source of truth and TypeScript types were regenerated correctly, several code locations in the worker service were missed during the migration and still referenced the deprecated `preference.timezone` fields:

1. `scheduler.ts:428` - `calculateNextRunTime()` read from `preference.timezone`
2. `scheduler.ts:641` - SELECT query included non-existent `timezone` column from `user_sms_preferences`
3. `index.ts:172` - `/queue/brief` endpoint read from `user_brief_preferences.timezone`
4. `briefGenerator.ts:83` - `generateDailyBrief()` read from `user_brief_preferences.timezone`

**Fix Applied**:
Updated all remaining code to consistently fetch timezone from `users.timezone` table:

1. Modified `calculateNextRunTime()` to accept optional `userTimezone` parameter instead of reading from preference object
2. Removed `timezone` from SELECT query on `user_sms_preferences` table
3. Updated `/queue/brief` endpoint to fetch timezone from `users` table (combined with existing user validation query)
4. Updated `generateDailyBrief()` to fetch timezone from `users` table instead of `user_brief_preferences`
5. Removed outdated type assertion comments that claimed types hadn't been regenerated

**Files Changed**:

- `apps/worker/src/scheduler.ts:428-433` - Added `userTimezone` parameter to `calculateNextRunTime()`
- `apps/worker/src/scheduler.ts:285-289` - Pass timezone from map when calling `calculateNextRunTime()`
- `apps/worker/src/scheduler.ts:641` - Removed `timezone` from SELECT query
- `apps/worker/src/scheduler.ts:675-680` - Removed type assertion comments
- `apps/worker/src/index.ts:153-165` - Combined user validation and timezone fetch into single query
- `apps/worker/src/workers/brief/briefGenerator.ts:77-83` - Fetch timezone from `users` table

**Manual Verification**:

1. Run `cd apps/worker && pnpm typecheck` - should pass without timezone-related errors
2. Test brief scheduling: Update user timezone via UI, verify brief scheduled at correct time in user's timezone
3. Test SMS reminders: Verify SMS scheduled using correct timezone from users table
4. Check worker logs: Confirm "Fetching from users.timezone" pattern in scheduler logs
5. Verify batch fetching: Confirm scheduler uses single batch query for all user timezones (performance optimization)

**Related Documentation**:

- `/thoughts/shared/research/2025-10-13_timezone-centralization-COMPLETE.md` - Updated to note incomplete worker migration
- `/apps/worker/src/scheduler.ts` - Now fully migrated to centralized timezone
- `/docs/BUGFIX_CHANGELOG.md` - This entry

**Cross-references**:

- Research: `/thoughts/shared/research/2025-10-13_timezone-centralization-COMPLETE.md` (claimed complete but was incomplete)
- Initial analysis: `/thoughts/shared/research/2025-10-13_04-55-45_overlapping-notification-preferences-analysis.md`
- Migration: `/supabase/migrations/20251013_centralize_timezone_to_users_table.sql`
- Schema: `/packages/shared-types/src/database.schema.ts:1198` - `users.timezone` column definition

**Confidence**: High - All code paths now consistently use `users.timezone`, TypeScript validation passes, pattern matches the documented migration approach

### [2025-10-13] Bug: SQL syntax error in timezone column drop migration

**Status**: Fixed
**Severity**: Small
**Affected Component**: Database Migrations

**Symptoms**:

- Migration `20251013_drop_deprecated_timezone_columns.sql` fails with syntax error: `ERROR: 42601: syntax error at or near "RAISE" LINE 101`
- Migration cannot execute, blocking cleanup of deprecated timezone columns
- Error message indicates RAISE NOTICE statements are in invalid context

**Root Cause**:
PostgreSQL requires `RAISE` statements (including `RAISE NOTICE`) to be executed within PL/pgSQL procedural blocks (`DO $$ ... END $$` or functions), not in plain SQL. The migration file had standalone `RAISE NOTICE` statements in Phase 3 (lines 101-117) and in the success messages section (lines 162-165) that were outside of DO blocks, violating PostgreSQL syntax rules.

**Fix Applied**:
Wrapped all standalone `RAISE NOTICE` statements in `DO $$ BEGIN ... END $$` blocks to provide the required PL/pgSQL context:

1. Phase 3 column drop notifications (5 RAISE statements) - each wrapped in individual DO blocks
2. Final success messages (4 RAISE statements) - wrapped in single DO block

**Files Changed**:

- `supabase/migrations/20251013_drop_deprecated_timezone_columns.sql:101-136` - Wrapped Phase 3 RAISE NOTICE statements in DO blocks
- `supabase/migrations/20251013_drop_deprecated_timezone_columns.sql:181-187` - Wrapped success message RAISE NOTICE statements in DO block

**Manual Verification**:

1. Run the migration using `pnpm supabase migration up` or Supabase CLI
2. Verify migration executes successfully without syntax errors
3. Check migration output shows all RAISE NOTICE messages (backup status, column drop confirmations, success messages)
4. Confirm timezone columns are successfully dropped from: `user_brief_preferences`, `user_sms_preferences`, `user_calendar_preferences`, `user_notification_preferences`
5. Verify `users.timezone` column remains intact as single source of truth

**Related Documentation**:

- `/supabase/migrations/20251013_drop_deprecated_timezone_columns.sql` - The fixed migration file
- `/docs/BUGFIX_CHANGELOG.md` - This entry

**Cross-references**:

- Research: `/thoughts/shared/research/2025-10-13_timezone-centralization-COMPLETE.md`
- Related migration: `supabase/migrations/20251013_centralize_timezone_to_users_table.sql`
- Architecture context: Part of timezone centralization effort to use `users.timezone` as single source of truth

**Confidence**: High - Fix directly addresses PostgreSQL syntax requirements, and pattern is used correctly elsewhere in the same migration file

### Example: [2025-10-13] Bug: Notification preferences not being respected for daily SMS

**Status**: Fixed
**Severity**: Medium
**Affected Component**: Notification System (Worker)

**Symptoms**:

- Users receiving SMS notifications even when they've disabled them
- Notification preferences table shows correct settings but they're not applied
- Only affects daily brief SMS, email notifications work correctly

**Root Cause**:
The SMS adapter in the worker service was checking `user.notification_enabled` instead of the more specific `user_notification_preferences.sms_enabled` field. This meant the global notification toggle was being checked, but not the SMS-specific preference.

**Fix Applied**:
Updated `/apps/worker/src/workers/notification/smsAdapter.ts` to:

1. Query `user_notification_preferences` table for SMS-specific settings
2. Check both `notification_enabled` AND `sms_enabled` before sending
3. Added preference checking logic to `shouldSendSMS()` function

**Files Changed**:

- `apps/worker/src/workers/notification/smsAdapter.ts:45-67` - Added SMS preference checking
- `apps/worker/src/workers/notification/preferenceChecker.ts:1-89` - Created new preference checker utility
- `packages/shared-types/src/database.schema.ts:1031` - Verified `user_notification_preferences` schema

**Manual Verification**:

1. Disable SMS notifications for a test user in the preferences UI
2. Trigger a daily brief job for that user
3. Verify no SMS is sent (check Twilio logs)
4. Re-enable SMS notifications
5. Trigger another daily brief
6. Verify SMS is sent

**Related Documentation**:

- `/apps/worker/docs/features/notifications/README.md` - Updated with preference checking flow
- `/apps/web/docs/features/notifications/README.md` - Added cross-reference to worker implementation
- `/docs/BUGFIX_CHANGELOG.md` - This entry

**Cross-references**:

- Research: `/thoughts/shared/research/2025-10-13_04-55-45_overlapping-notification-preferences-analysis.md`
- Feature spec: `/apps/web/docs/features/notifications/NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCES_SPEC.md`

**Confidence**: High - Fix directly addresses the root cause and covers all SMS sending paths
