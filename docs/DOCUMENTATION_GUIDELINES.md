# Documentation Guidelines for LLMs and Contributors

**Last Updated:** October 3, 2025  
**Purpose:** Ensure all documentation is properly organized and not floating around randomly

---

## 🎯 Core Principle

**Every document has a home.** No random architecture docs, design specs, or summaries should be created at the root or in arbitrary locations.

---

## 📁 Where to Put Documentation

### Research Documents → `/thoughts/shared/research/`

**When creating research documents** (analyzing the codebase, investigating features, exploring architecture):

**Location:** `/thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_topic.md`

**Required Format:**

```markdown
---
date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]
researcher: [Researcher name, e.g., 'Claude Code']
git_commit: [Current commit hash]
branch: [Current branch name]
repository: buildos-platform
topic: '[Clear topic description]'
tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]
status: complete
last_updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
last_updated_by: [Researcher name]
---

# Research: [Topic]

**Date**: [timestamp]
**Researcher**: [name]
**Git Commit**: [hash]

## Research Question

[What you were investigating]

## Summary

[High-level findings]

## Detailed Findings

[Component-by-component breakdown with file:line references]

## Code References

- `path/to/file.ts:123` - Description

## Architecture Insights

[Patterns and design decisions discovered]

## Related Research

[Links to other research docs]
```

**Examples of research topics:**

- "How does the brain dump processing flow work?"
- "Calendar integration webhook system analysis"
- "Notification system architecture investigation"
- "Queue worker job processing patterns"

**Key Rules:**

- ✅ Always use timestamp format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_topic.md`
- ✅ Include YAML frontmatter with metadata
- ✅ Reference actual code with file:line citations
- ✅ Link to related research documents
- ❌ Don't create research docs outside `/thoughts/shared/research/`
- ❌ Don't use vague filenames like "analysis.md" or "notes.md"

---

### Architecture Documentation → `/docs/architecture/`

**When documenting system-wide architecture** (affects multiple apps, deployment topology, cross-cutting patterns):

**Location Options:**

- `/docs/architecture/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` - High-level system architecture
- `/docs/architecture/DATA_FLOW.md` - Cross-app data flows
- `/docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-NNN-topic.md` - Architecture Decision Records
- `/docs/architecture/diagrams/` - Architecture diagrams

**When to use:**

- System-level architecture that crosses app boundaries
- Deployment topology and infrastructure decisions
- Cross-cutting architectural patterns
- ADRs affecting multiple apps

**Format for ADRs:**

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: [Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]
**Deciders:** [Names]
**Related ADRs:** [Links]

## Context

[What is the issue we're facing?]

## Decision

[What did we decide?]

## Consequences

[What becomes easier/harder with this decision?]

## Alternatives Considered

[What other options did we evaluate?]
```

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

### ❌ Don't Create These Files

**At Root Level:**

- ❌ `architecture.md` → Use `/docs/architecture/`
- ❌ `design-doc.md` → Use feature-specific docs
- ❌ `implementation-notes.md` → Use feature-specific docs
- ❌ `research.md` → Use `/thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_topic.md`
- ❌ `analysis.md` → Use `/thoughts/shared/research/`
- ❌ `notes.md` → Use appropriate feature folder
- ❌ `summary.md` → Use appropriate feature folder

**Random Locations:**

- ❌ Don't create docs in `/src/` unless they're code-level comments
- ❌ Don't create architectural docs in feature folders (use `/docs/architecture/`)
- ❌ Don't mix web and worker docs in the same folder

**Vague Filenames:**

- ❌ `temp.md`, `notes.md`, `stuff.md`
- ✅ Use descriptive names: `brain-dump-processing-flow.md`

---

## 📝 Checklist for Creating Documentation

Before creating ANY documentation file, ask:

- [ ] Have I determined the correct location using the decision tree?
- [ ] Is there already a similar document I should update instead?
- [ ] Does the folder have a README.md? (If not, create one first)
- [ ] Am I using a descriptive filename (not "notes.md" or "temp.md")?
- [ ] For research: Am I using the timestamp format `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_topic.md`?
- [ ] For research: Have I included YAML frontmatter with all required fields?
- [ ] Have I linked to related documentation?
- [ ] Have I included code references with file:line citations?

---

## 🔄 When to Update vs. Create New

### Update Existing Documentation When:

- Adding information to an existing topic
- Correcting outdated information
- Expanding on existing features
- Following up on previous research (append to same file with timestamp)

### Create New Documentation When:

- Researching a completely new topic (new research doc)
- Documenting a new feature (new feature folder + README)
- Recording a new architectural decision (new ADR)
- Creating a new implementation guide

**For Research Follow-ups:**

- Don't create a new research file if it's related to existing research
- Instead, append to the existing file with a new section:

    ```markdown
    ## Follow-up Research [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]

    [New findings]
    ```

- Update frontmatter:
    ```yaml
    last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
    last_updated_by: [Your name]
    last_updated_note: 'Added follow-up research for [description]'
    ```

## 🎨 Documentation Standards

### File Naming Conventions

**Research Files:**

- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_descriptive-topic.md`
- Example: `2025-10-03_14-30-00_brain-dump-processing-flow.md`

**Feature Documentation:**

- Format: `descriptive-name.md` or `FEATURE_NAME_SPEC.md`
- Example: `brain-dump-processing-spec.md`, `calendar-sync-architecture.md`

**Architecture Decision Records:**

- Format: `ADR-NNN-short-title.md` (NNN = zero-padded number)
- Example: `ADR-001-supabase-choice.md`, `ADR-002-dual-processing.md`

### Markdown Standards

**Headers:**

- Use sentence case: "Brain dump processing flow" not "Brain Dump Processing Flow"
- One H1 per document (the title)
- Logical hierarchy: H2 → H3 → H4

**Code References:**

- Always include file paths: `` `src/lib/services/brain-dump.ts:45` ``
- Link to specific lines when referencing code
- Use relative paths from repo root

**Links:**

- Use relative links for internal docs: `[Architecture](/docs/architecture/README.md)`
- Use absolute links for external resources
- Always verify links work before committing
