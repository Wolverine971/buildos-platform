## Top 5 Actions to Move the Needle

### 1. Expand homepage content to 800-1500 words

Add an Enneagram explainer section, type descriptions, and visible FAQ block. The homepage currently reads as a collection of taglines (~400 words). Search engines reward pages that demonstrate depth. This alone could lift the Content score from 38 to 65+.

### 2. Add founder bio with credentials

Add a named author ("DJ Wayne"), an "About the founder" blurb on the homepage, and Person schema in JSON-LD. For a site offering personality coaching and psychological frameworks, demonstrable expertise is essential for E-E-A-T. Include credentials, experience, or a short bio linking to the `/about` page.

### 3. Fix structured data graph connections

Consolidate all JSON-LD into a single `@graph` block. Add `@id` to WebPage (`https://9takes.com/#webpage`), link it to WebSite via `isPartOf` and to Organization via `publisher`. Add a BreadcrumbList schema. This could lift Structured Data from 52 to 80+.

**Target structure:**

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@graph": [
    { "@type": "Organization", "@id": "https://9takes.com/#organization", ... },
    { "@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://9takes.com/#website", "publisher": {"@id": "https://9takes.com/#organization"}, ... },
    { "@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://9takes.com/#webpage", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://9takes.com/#website"}, "publisher": {"@id": "https://9takes.com/#organization"}, ... },
    { "@type": "BreadcrumbList", ... },
    { "@type": "FAQPage", ... }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Self-host fonts and reduce to 2-3 weights

Eliminate the render-blocking Google Fonts CSS request (currently loading Rajdhani, Space Grotesk, and JetBrains Mono across 11 weight variants). Self-host the subset you actually use and load via `<link rel="preload" as="font">`. This is the single biggest LCP improvement available.

### 5. Add width/height to all avatar images

The 9 celebrity avatar images lack explicit `width` and `height` attributes, causing layout shift (CLS) as images load. Quick fix: add dimensions to each `<img>` tag. This directly improves Core Web Vitals.

## Detailed Category Breakdowns

### Technical SEO (82/100)

**Strengths:** Canonical tags, redirect handling (308), trailing slash normalization, robots.txt, URL structure, SSR, proper 404s, image sitemap with 748 entries, RSS feed.

**Weaknesses:** Inner pages missing `meta robots` and `hreflang` tags (homepage-only implementation). Sitemap uses meaningless uniform `priority` values and deprecated `changefreq`. `/blog` path orphaned from navigation. Sitemap approaching the size where a sitemap index would help.

### Content (38/100)

**Strengths:** Clean heading hierarchy, strong meta title/description, good internal linking volume, logical content flow.

**Weaknesses:** This is the weakest category by far. The homepage is severely thin (~400 words), with no substantive prose explaining what the Enneagram is, how the platform works, or why visitors should trust 9takes. No social proof, no testimonials, no founder credentials. Target keywords appear in headers but not in natural body paragraphs. The dynamic question-of-day H2 provides no consistent SEO signal.

### Performance (72/100)

**Strengths:** WebP images, eager/lazy split, immutable asset hashing, non-render-blocking JS modules, SSR, small HTML payload, HTTP/2, no heavy third-party scripts, `font-display: swap`.

**Weaknesses:** Google Fonts loading 11 variants is the biggest bottleneck. 6 render-blocking CSS files include non-critical component styles. Avatar images lack dimensions (CLS). No `fetchpriority` hints. ~48 modulepreload hints cause bandwidth contention. HTML has no browser caching (`max-age=0`).

### Security (78/100)

**Strengths:** HTTPS/HTTP2, HSTS (2yr), X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, strict Referrer-Policy, comprehensive Permissions-Policy, CSP with `object-src: none`, `base-uri: self`, `form-action` restrictions, proper social link `rel` attributes.

**Weaknesses:** CSP weakened by `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` in script-src (common in SvelteKit but reduces XSS protection). HSTS lacks `includeSubDomains` and `preload`. No COOP/CORP headers. `Cache-Control: public` on potentially auth-gated pages.

### Structured Data (52/100)

**Strengths:** Three JSON-LD blocks present and syntactically valid. `@graph` pattern used correctly. Organization has `@id`, logo, `sameAs`. WebPage has well-formed `primaryImageOfPage`. FAQPage correctly structured (5 Q&A pairs).

**Weaknesses:** WebPage is disconnected from the graph (no `@id`, no `isPartOf`, no `publisher`). WebSite lacks `publisher` link to Organization. Organization missing `description`, `foundingDate`, `contactPoint`. No BreadcrumbList. FAQPage won't trigger rich results on a commercial site (retained for LLM citation only).

### AEO -- AI Engine Optimization (92/100)

**Strengths:** Best-in-class AI crawler access -- all 6 major AI crawlers explicitly allowed. `llms.txt` present and well-authored with "Preferred understanding" section guiding AI interpretation. SSR ensures content visibility without JS. Short, assertion-first paragraphs are ideal for AI citation. FAQ schema provides directly extractable Q&A pairs. Sitemap declared for AI crawler discovery.

**Weaknesses:** No `llms-full.txt` with article-level URLs and summaries. `anthropic-ai` user-agent not explicitly listed (covered by default rule). `llms.txt` only lists section URLs, not individual high-value articles. No `max-snippet:-1` or similar AI-indexing hints.
