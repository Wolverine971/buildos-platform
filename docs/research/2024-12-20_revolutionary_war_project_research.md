## Historical Context (1765-1775)

### The Road to Revolution

The American Revolution did not begin suddenly. It was the culmination of a decade of escalating tensions between the British Crown and its American colonies.

#### The Stamp Act Crisis (1765)

**Date**: March 22, 1765

The British Parliament passed the Stamp Act, requiring colonists to pay a tax on every piece of printed paper they used. This was the first direct tax on the colonies.

**Colonial Response**:

- "No taxation without representation" became the rallying cry
- Stamp Act Congress met in New York (October 1765)
- Boycotts of British goods organized
- Sons of Liberty formed in Boston

**Significance**: Established the principle that colonies would resist Parliamentary taxation

---

**Date**: June-July 1767

Parliament imposed duties on glass, lead, paints, paper, and tea imported to the colonies.

**Colonial Response**:

- Renewed boycotts

- British troops sent to Boston (October 1768)

---

#### The Boston Massacre (March 5, 1770)

British soldiers fired into a crowd of colonists, killing five. This became a powerful propaganda event.

**Victims**:

    - Required colonists to house British troops

5. **Quebec Act** (June 22, 1774)
    - Extended Quebec's boundaries
    - Granted religious freedom to Catholics
    - Colonists saw this as threat to Protestant colonies

## The Founding of the Continental Marines

### The Strategic Problem

By autumn 1775, the Continental Congress faced a critical military capability gap. The British Royal Navy was the most powerful maritime force in the world, possessing over 270 ships of the line and frigates. The American colonies had **zero** naval capability.

**British Naval Advantages**:

- Complete control of the seas
- Ability to blockade any port at will
- Capacity to land troops anywhere along 1,500 miles of coastline
- Power to interdict colonial commerce and fishing
- Capability to resupply British armies by sea
- Ability to evacuate troops if threatened

**The Nascent Continental Navy**:
On October 13, 1775, the Continental Congress authorized the purchase of two vessels to intercept British supply ships. This was the birth of the Continental Navy, but ships without trained fighting men were vulnerable.

### Why Marines Were Necessary

Naval warfare in the 18th century was dramatically different from land warfare. Ships required a specialized fighting force that could:

1. **Serve as Sharpshooters in the Fighting Tops**
    - Marines stationed in the masts and rigging
    - Aimed at enemy officers, helmsmen, and gun crews
    - Could sweep enemy decks with musket fire during close action

2. **Lead and Execute Boarding Parties**
    - Close combat with cutlass, pistol, and boarding pike
    - Capture enemy vessels
    - Seize cargo and prisoners

3. **Repel Enemy Boarders**
    - Defend their own ship against attack
    - Protect officers and critical crew

4. **Maintain Shipboard Discipline**
    - Prevent mutiny (a real concern with pressed sailors)
    - Guard prisoners and valuables
    - Provide security for officers

5. **Conduct Amphibious Operations**
    - Land on enemy shores
    - Seize forts, supplies, and strategic positions
    - Raid and withdraw

6. **Man the Great Guns**
    - Serve on gun crews during battle
    - Provide additional manpower for heavy work

This was a **distinct skillset** from both regular infantry and sailors. Soldiers lacked sea legs and shipboard training. Sailors were skilled at sailing but not necessarily at fighting. Marines combined both capabilities.

### The Resolution of November 10, 1775

On **November 10, 1775**, the Second Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, passed the following resolution:

> _"Resolved, That two Battalions of Marines be raised, consisting of one Colonel, two Lieutenant Colonels, two Majors, and other officers as usual in other regiments; and that they consist of an equal number of privates with other battalions; that particular care be taken, that no persons be appointed to office, or enlisted into said Battalions, but such as are good seamen, or so acquainted with maritime affairs as to be able to serve to advantage by sea when required; that they be enlisted and commissioned to serve for and during the present war between Great Britain and the colonies, unless dismissed by order of Congress: that they be distinguished by the names of the first and second battalions of American Marines, and that they be considered as part of the number which the continental Army before Boston is ordered to consist of."_

**Key Elements of the Resolution**:

1. **Two Battalions Authorized**: Approximately 600-800 men total
2. **Full Officer Corps**: Colonel, Lieutenant Colonels, Majors, Captains, Lieutenants
3. **Maritime Requirement**: Must be "good seamen" or "acquainted with maritime affairs"
4. **Duration**: For the present war unless dismissed
5. **Designation**: "First and Second Battalions of American Marines"
6. **Integration**: Part of the Continental Army establishment

**Champion of the Resolution**: **John Adams** of Massachusetts

Adams, who would later be called "the Father of the American Navy," understood that naval power projection required this specialized force. His advocacy was crucial to the resolution's passage.

### Captain Samuel Nicholas - First Commandant

**Samuel Nicholas** (1744-1790) was appointed as the senior Marine officer. Though his official title was "Captain of Marines," he is recognized as the first Commandant of the Marine Corps.

**Background**:

- Born in Philadelphia to a prominent Quaker family
- Successful businessman and innkeeper
- Member of the Gloucester Fox Hunting Club (elite Philadelphia society)
- Well-connected with Philadelphia's mercantile and political leadership
- No prior military experience, but possessed organizational skills

**Character and Abilities**:

---

### Tun Tavern - Birthplace of the Marine Corps

Nicholas established his recruiting headquarters at **Tun Tavern**, located on Water Street (now Front Street) in Philadelphia.

**About Tun Tavern**:

- Established around 1685
- Located near the Philadelphia waterfront
- Popular gathering place for sailors, merchants, and tradesmen
- Already famous as the birthplace of Freemasonry in America (1732)
- Owned by **Robert Mullan**, who served as a recruiting officer

**Why Tun Tavern?**:

- Strategic location near the docks
- Attracted exactly the kind of men suited for Marine service:
    - Experienced sailors
    - Dockworkers and longshoremen
    - Watermen and fishermen
    - Adventurers and tough characters
- Established tavern with good reputation
- Owner willing to support the cause

**Recruiting Methods**:

- Mullan offered recruits "a cold beer and a hot meal"
- Recruiting posters and handbills
- Word of mouth in the maritime community
- Promise of regular pay and prize money
- Appeal to patriotism and adventure

**The Tradition Lives On**:
November 10 is celebrated as the Marine Corps Birthday. Marines worldwide gather to commemorate the founding at Tun Tavern with the traditional reading of General Lejeune's birthday message and the cutting of a cake with a sword.

### The First Marines

#### Who Joined?

The first Continental Marines were a diverse group:

- **Sailors** seeking better pay and conditions than merchant service
- **Dockworkers** looking for adventure and purpose
- **Watermen** (ferrymen, boatmen) familiar with small craft
- **Artisans** with useful skills (carpenters, blacksmiths)
- **Young men** seeking glory and independence
- **Immigrants** (particularly Irish and Scottish) with military traditions
- **Former soldiers** with combat experience

#### Motivations for Enlisting

1. **Regular Pay**: $6.67 per month for privates (when Congress could pay)
2. **Prize Money**: Share of captured vessels and cargo
3. **Patriotism**: Belief in the cause of independence
4. **Adventure**: Chance to see action and travel
5. **Status**: Elite force with distinct identity
6. **Escape**: From debts, troubles, or boredom

#### Initial Strength

Nicholas recruited approximately **300 men** in the first weeks, forming the nucleus of the Continental Marines. The authorized strength of two battalions (~800 men) was never achieved.
