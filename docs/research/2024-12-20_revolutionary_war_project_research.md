## The Founding of the Continental Marines

### Strategic Context

By late 1775, the Continental Congress faced a critical capability gap. The British Royal Navy was the most powerful maritime force in the world, and the nascent American rebellion had virtually no naval capability. The British could:

- Blockade colonial ports at will
- Land troops anywhere along the coastline
- Strangle colonial commerce
- Resupply their armies by sea

The Continental Navy was being established, but ships without trained shipboard soldiers were vulnerable. Naval warfare of the era required specialized troops who could:

1. Serve as sharpshooters in the rigging during engagements
2. Lead boarding parties to capture enemy vessels
3. Maintain discipline and prevent mutiny aboard ship
4. Conduct amphibious raids on enemy positions
5. Provide security for naval officers and facilities

This was a distinct skillset from both regular infantry and sailors, requiring a new type of force.

### The Resolution of November 10, 1775

On November 10, 1775, the Second Continental Congress passed a resolution:

> *"Resolved, That two Battalions of Marines be raised, consisting of one Colonel, two Lieutenant Colonels, two Majors, and other officers as usual in other regiments; and that they consist of an equal number of privates with other battalions; that particular care be taken, that no persons be appointed to office, or enlisted into said Battalions, but such as are good seamen, or so acquainted with maritime affairs as to be able to serve to advantage by sea when required; that they be enlisted and commissioned to serve for and during the present war between Great Britain and the colonies, unless dismissed by order of Congress: that they be distinguished by the names of the first and second battalions of American Marines..."*

The resolution was championed by **John Adams** of Massachusetts, who understood that naval power projection required this specialized force. Adams would later be called "the Father of the American Navy" for his advocacy of American sea power.

### Captain Samuel Nicholas - First Commandant

**Samuel Nicholas** (1744-1790) was selected as the senior officer of the Continental Marines, recognized as the first Commandant (though his official title was "Captain of Marines").

Nicholas was:
- A Philadelphia businessman and innkeeper
- Member of a prominent Quaker family (though clearly not adhering to pacifist principles)
- Well-connected in Philadelphia society
- Experienced in organizing men for purpose

He established his recruiting headquarters at **Tun Tavern** on Water Street in Philadelphia.

### Tun Tavern - Birthplace of the Marines

Tun Tavern was a well-known waterfront establishment owned by **Robert Mullan**, who served as a recruiting officer. The choice was strategic:

- Located near the Philadelphia docks
- Popular gathering place for sailors, dockworkers, and seafaring men
- These were exactly the kind of tough, experienced men suited for Marine service
- Mullan reportedly offered recruits "a cold beer and a hot meal"

The tradition of recruiting at taverns resonates with Marine Corps culture to this day.

### Who Joined and Why

The first Marines were a diverse group:
- Experienced sailors seeking better pay
- Dockworkers looking for adventure
- Adventurers attracted to the cause
- Men seeking steady pay in uncertain times
- Those motivated by independence ideology

The appeal was straightforward:
1. Regular pay (when Congress could provide it)
2. Promise of prize money from captured ships
3. Chance to fight for independence
4. Status as elite troops

Nicholas recruited approximately **300 men** initially, forming the nucleus of the Corps.

### The First Uniform

Continental Marines wore:
- Green coats with white facings (green was chosen to differentiate from British red and Army blue)
- White waistcoat and breeches
- Round black hats
- Leather collar (the origin of the nickname "Leathernecks")

The leather collar protected the neck from sword slashes in close combat aboard ships.

## Major Marine Operations

### The Nassau Raid (March 1776)

**The First Amphibious Assault in Marine Corps History**

Just four months after the Corps was established, Marines conducted their first major operation.

**Background:**
- Continental Army desperately needed gunpowder, cannons, and military supplies
- British fort at Nassau, New Providence Island (Bahamas) held significant stores
- Commodore Esek Hopkins commanded a small fleet

**The Operation:**
- **Date**: March 3-4, 1776
- **Commander**: Captain Samuel Nicholas
- **Force**: ~250 Marines and 50 sailors
- **Objective**: Capture British forts and seize military supplies

**Execution:**
1. Fleet arrived at New Providence Island
2. Marines landed in small boats at night
3. Captured Fort Montagu on the eastern end of the island
4. Advanced on Fort Nassau (main fortification)
5. Governor Montfort Browne surrendered without significant resistance

**Results:**
- Captured 71 cannons
- Captured 15 mortars
- Seized significant gunpowder (though British shipped some away before capture)
- Strategic success - proved amphibious capability

**Significance:**
- Established amphibious assault as a Marine specialty
- Demonstrated offensive capability of the Continental forces
- Provided desperately needed military supplies
- Boosted colonial morale

### Marines Aboard Continental Navy Vessels

Throughout the war, Marines served aboard every significant Continental Navy vessel:

**Key Ships with Marine Detachments:**
- *Alfred* (flagship)
- *Columbus*
- *Andrea Doria*
- *Cabot*
- *Providence*
- *Ranger* (John Paul Jones)
- *Bonhomme Richard* (John Paul Jones)

**Marine Duties Aboard Ship:**
1. **Sharpshooter duty**: Stationed in the rigging to fire on enemy officers and crew
2. **Boarding parties**: Lead assaults to capture enemy vessels
3. **Repelling boarders**: Defend against enemy boarding attempts
4. **Security**: Guard against mutiny, protect officers, secure prisoners
5. **Gun crews**: Assist in manning cannon during engagements

### Battle of Princeton (January 3, 1777)

Marines demonstrated versatility by fighting alongside Washington's army in conventional land battles.

Following the victory at Trenton, Washington decided to press the attack against British forces at Princeton.

**Marine Participation:**
- Marines from the Philadelphia area joined Washington's force
- Fought as infantry alongside Continental soldiers
- Participated in the assault on British positions
- Suffered casualties alongside the Army

This engagement showed Marines could operate effectively both at sea and on land.

### Bonhomme Richard vs HMS Serapis (September 23, 1779)

One of the most famous naval engagements of the war featured Continental Marines prominently.

**Background:**
- Captain John Paul Jones commanded *Bonhomme Richard*
- Encountered British convoy escorted by *HMS Serapis* off Flamborough Head, England
- Jones's ship was older and outgunned

**Marine Role:**
- Marines in the rigging swept the enemy deck with musket fire
- Marine fire was so accurate that British crew couldn't effectively man their guns
- Marines prepared to lead boarding parties
- When ships became entangled, Marines fought in close combat

**Famous Quote:**
When asked if he would surrender his sinking ship, Jones reportedly said: *"I have not yet begun to fight!"*

**Outcome:**
- *Bonhomme Richard* sank after the battle
- Jones captured *HMS Serapis*
- Victory demonstrated American naval capability to European powers
- Marines' sharpshooting was credited as decisive factor

### Penobscot Expedition (July-August 1779)

**A Costly Lesson**

Marines participated in one of the war's greatest American disasters.

**Objective:** Dislodge British forces establishing a base at Penobscot Bay, Maine

**Force:**
- 19 warships
- 24 transport ships
- ~1,000 Marines and militiamen
- ~300 sailors

**Problems:**
- Poor coordination between Army and Navy commanders
- Indecision and delay in attacking
- British reinforcements arrived

**Result:**
- American fleet destroyed (largest naval defeat until Pearl Harbor)
- Heavy casualties
- All ships lost (some scuttled, some captured)

**Lessons:**
- Unity of command essential for amphibious operations
- Speed and decisiveness crucial
- Interservice cooperation necessary
