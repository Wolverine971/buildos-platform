# Manhattan Project Research (1939-1946)

## Executive Summary

The Manhattan Project was the secret U.S. government program that developed the first nuclear weapons during World War II. Running from 1942-1946, it employed over 130,000 people, cost $1.889 billion ($30+ billion in 2024 dollars), and culminated in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The project represented an unprecedented fusion of military command, industrial capacity, and scientific genius—transforming theoretical physics into practical weapons within just seven years.

The project operated across three primary sites: Oak Ridge, Tennessee (uranium enrichment), Hanford, Washington (plutonium production), and Los Alamos, New Mexico (bomb design and assembly). Under the military command of General Leslie Groves and the scientific direction of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the project achieved what many considered impossible while simultaneously sparking profound ethical debates that continue today.
