# get power over your schedule

For the notification trap, we are going to be better than google calendar. you can do bulk actions to schedule and unschedule projects and you can shift whole project scheduled timelines within our ui. This gives users power over their schedule.

# make ROI crystal clear

- The Problem: "Interesting" doesn't pay bills. Users need to say "This made/saved me $X"
- What 10x Founders Do: Create a value calculator in the product itself.

Build this into War Room:

'''Project Value: $50,000 (user inputs)
Risk Identified: Competition launches first
Mitigation Cost: 2 weeks acceleration = $5,000
Prevented Loss: $20,000 in lost market share
ROI: 4x in first scenario'''

## The Social Proof Machine:

Every Friday, prompt users: "What did BuildOS help you avoid this week?"
Aggregate and share: "This week, BuildOS users avoided $2.3M in project failures"

# The Use Case Confusion: Your 4D Chess Move

The Problem: BuildOS + War Room serves ADHD builders, writers, students, founders, PMs... that's not positioning, that's a grocery list.
What VCs Want: "We own [specific user] solving [specific problem]"
The 4D Strategy Move: Vertical Dominance Stacking
Start with ADHD builders. Why? They have:

Highest pain (unfinished projects everywhere)
Strongest word-of-mouth (ADHD communities are tight)
Clear before/after story (chaos → completion)
Willingness to pay (desperate for solutions)

Once you own ADHD builders (6-12 months), expand to adjacent verticals. Each conquest becomes your army for the next.
The message evolution:

Year 1: "BuildOS: Where ADHD builders finally finish"
Year 2: "BuildOS: The completion engine for creative minds"
Year 3: "BuildOS: How ambitious people ship"

# fighting copy cats

For the copy cats, buildos is focused on simplicity. You just take to it and it does what you say and organizes your projects. I could see users talking with ai about their wargaming scenarios and this is sticky because of the project context that is built up and is easy to use because you can interact with buildos and the wargaming stuff via voice.

# abandonware path

For the abandonware path I do need to proritize community features around this. We already created a skool community and will be celebrating what users build. We want to help users actually finish their projects.

# advantage over chatgpt

Chatgpt adding this wargaming prompt wont effect buildos becasue we wargame to learn and the learnings feedback into the projects in buildos.
