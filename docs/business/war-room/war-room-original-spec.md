I have a project called buildos and attached is the context document.

A new feature I want to work on is project war room. So you have your project that you have been continually updating via braindumps and regular manual project organization and its your baby. Now you want to protect your baby. Its time to take your baby to the war room.

The war room is where you stress test your ideas and projects.

Your task is to spec out a complete and thurough design document for this.

Ai is really good at predicting and forecasting events and war room is a place that takes advantage of that.

So you can put your project through scenarios and map out what could happen and prepare for different scenarios and situations. I need to create a system for this.

I want this to be interactive.

But the first thing is to assess which projects are available for the war room. In this pre step ai will assess a project's current state and see if it is ready for the war room. I need to develop criteria for this. What I am thinking is does the project have clear goals. Does the project have an end date. Is the project small in scope or is the project large in scope. These are all factors that should play into the scenario design.

Please think through other different criteria that I should check for that will make the scenarios be insightful.

So here is the sequence of events.

First thing to do on the page is click a project where you want to take to the war room. In this stage the ai will check if it is ready for the war room.

If it is not ready for the war room it will prompt you about a bunch of different things inorder to meet the war room ready criteria.

If it is ready then the user will choose what kindof scenario it wants to play out. So there should be 2 options, One where the user can talk about a specific scenario that they want feedback on and want ai to project out different scenarios. And the other option is for the AI to map out potential scenarios. These scenarios should be generated once and appear as options. And if the user doesnt like the scenarios it can ask to regenerate the scenarios and give some direction about the different scenarios that they want mapped out.

This should be a text box where a user can say I want you to test out this specific scenario that I am thinking about.

In this you can customize the number of variations of the scenario. There should be some other things you can test out in this flow, please think through the possibilities and give me suggestions.

For the generated scenarios it should be a small skeletoon of a scenario that you want to see played out. It should have 3 statements.

What happened, what this effected, and it should are the possible different outcomes. And the variations that come from these scenarios should be driven by what the user selected.

After these outcomes are generated, a user can select to expand into the scenario or tweak it.

If the ai is asked to expand upon the scenario then it will go and expand upon what led to the scenario and what was effected and elaborate on all the side effects and outcomes.

This will kindof be like a dungeons and dragons type flow but it is based on stress testing your projects.

Ask me any questions before you get started so we have the right strategy for this.
If you have confusing or under specified information please stop and ask for clarity before executing on workflows
I want you to create a design doc for this so that I can build out this flow.
