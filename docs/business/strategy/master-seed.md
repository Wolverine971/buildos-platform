## ‚ú® Core System Features

### üß† Brain Dump ‚Üí Structured Intelligence

**Input**: Raw thoughts, notes, voice memos, scattered ideas
**Output**: Structured projects with rich markdown context, actionable tasks, organized phases, and captured notes

The system intelligently classifies and structures unorganized input into:

- **Projects**: Tactical initiatives with phases, deliverables, and timelines
- **Markdown Context**: Rich text context that captures project strategy, status, and insights
- **Phases**: Sequential project stages that organize tasks logically
- **Tasks**: Atomic actions (one_off or recurring) tied to projects/phases
- **Notes**: Unrefined thoughts, research, and insights for future processing
- **Calendar Events**: Tasks automatically scheduled based on availability and preferences üìÖ

### üìÖ Google Calendar Integration

**Seamless Time Management**:
Build OS deeply integrates with Google Calendar to transform task management into scheduled execution:

**Core Features**:

- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication**: Secure connection with automatic token refresh
- **Two-way Sync**: Tasks create calendar events, calendar changes update task status
- **Smart Scheduling**: AI finds optimal time slots based on your preferences
- **Work Hours Respect**: Only schedules during your defined working hours
- **Holiday Awareness**: Automatically avoids scheduling on holidays
- **Time Zone Intelligence**: Handles multiple time zones seamlessly

**Calendar Preferences**:

- Define work start/end times
- Set working days of the week
- Configure task duration defaults (min/max/default)
- Enable morning preference for important tasks
- Set holiday country code for automatic exclusion
- Choose your primary time zone

**Scheduling Intelligence**:

- Analyzes calendar free/busy times
- Suggests optimal slots for deep work
- Respects task dependencies when scheduling
- Groups related tasks in time blocks
- Handles recurring task patterns
- Provides 10+ available slot options

### üéØ Project Context Generation

**Military-Inspired Framework**:
The system uses a 5-lens analysis framework (inspired by military planning) to generate comprehensive project context:

1. **SITUATION** - Current reality, problems, opportunities, constraints
2. **MISSION** - Goals, success criteria, value proposition, outcomes
3. **EXECUTION** - Approach, strategy, phases, key decisions
4. **OPERATIONS** - Resources, time, tools, day-to-day requirements
5. **COORDINATION** - Communication, stakeholders, feedback, tracking

**Context Generation Process**:

- When a new project is created from a brain dump, the LLM analyzes the content
- Generates rich markdown context with relevant sections for that project
- Context is stored as markdown text with ## headers for different aspects
- Context evolves over time as new information is added through brain dumps
- **Calendar-aware insights**: Include time management and scheduling considerations

**Example Markdown Context Sections**:

- Software Project: `## Technical Architecture`, `## Deployment Strategy`, `## Sprint Planning`
- Creative Project: `## Artistic Vision`, `## Content Calendar`, `## Audience Strategy`
- Business Project: `## Revenue Model`, `## Market Analysis`, `## Growth Strategy`
- Personal Project: `## Success Metrics`, `## Habit Formation`, `## Progress Tracking`

### üéØ Project Phase Management

**AI-Powered Phase Generation**:

- Analyzes project context, tasks, and notes to create 2-8 logical phases
- Respects task dependencies when assigning tasks to phases
- Handles flexible project timelines (can work with partial or missing dates)
- Separates recurring tasks that span multiple phases
- Creates backlog for unassigned tasks
- **Calendar Integration**: Suggests phase dates based on calendar availability

**Phase Features**:

- **Kanban View**: Card-based visualization of phases with task lists
- **Timeline View**: Gantt-style visualization with progress tracking
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time completion percentage per phase
- **Status Indicators**: Upcoming, Active, or Completed phases
- **Date Management**: Inline editing of project start/end dates
- **Calendar Sync**: Phase milestones can be added to calendar

### üìù Information Hierarchy

**Context vs. Notes Distinction:**

- **Context** = Rich markdown content that defines what a project IS (strategy, goals, status, approach)
- **Notes** = Semi-structured information capture that represents what you're THINKING about related to that project

**Notes serve as:**

- A parking lot for incomplete thoughts and ideas
- Storage for research findings and external information
- Capture of insights and observations from brain dumps
- Repository for information that isn't yet actionable or contextual
- **Time-sensitive reminders** that can be converted to scheduled tasks

### üìä Daily Brief Generator

Each morning or on-demand, LLMs generate personalized intelligence reports:

- **Project Status**: Active initiatives, bottlenecks, critical path items
- **Phase Progress**: Current phase status and upcoming phase transitions
- **Priority Matrix**: Today's high-impact tasks across all projects
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Alignment checks, optimization suggestions
- **Dependency Alerts**: Blocked tasks, waiting-on items, timeline risks
- **Note Processing Opportunities**: Unprocessed notes ready for conversion to tasks/context
- **Today's Calendar**: Tasks scheduled for today with time blocks
- **Available Time Slots**: Open windows for additional work
- **Upcoming Deadlines**: Tasks due within your planning horizon

### üéØ Smart Task Architecture

Tasks intelligently connect to the tactical layer:

- **one_off Tasks**: One-time actions with clear completion criteria
- **Recurring Tasks**: Habit-building actions with flexible scheduling
- **Phase Assignment**: Tasks organized into project phases with suggested start dates
- **Project Linking**: Tasks directly support specific projects
- **Dependency Tracking**: Complex workflows with prerequisite mapping
- **Calendar Events**: Tasks automatically create calendar events when scheduled
- **Duration Estimates**: Each task includes time estimates for better scheduling
- **Time Preferences**: Tasks can specify preferred time of day (morning/afternoon/evening)

## ü§ñ LLM Usage Instructions

When processing Build OS data:

### Information Hierarchy

- **Projects** ‚Üí Tactical execution context with rich markdown content
- **Project Context** ‚Üí Markdown sections that capture strategy, status, challenges, and approach
- **Phases** ‚Üí Sequential project stages organizing tasks logically
- **Tasks** ‚Üí Atomic actionable items linked to projects/phases
- **Notes** ‚Üí Unrefined thoughts and information for future processing
- **Calendar Events** ‚Üí Scheduled execution blocks for tasks

### Project Context Generation Rules

When generating context for a new project:

1. Analyze the brain dump through the 5 lenses (Situation, Mission, Execution, Operations, Coordination)
2. Create relevant markdown sections (## headers) that capture the most important aspects
3. Focus on actionable, specific information rather than generic content
4. Adapt sections to project type (software, creative, business, personal, etc.)
5. **Include time-related insights**: Consider scheduling, deadlines, and time management
6. Use rich markdown formatting with lists, emphasis, and structure

### Context Evolution and Merging

When updating existing project context:

- **Preserve existing valuable content**: Don't overwrite good information
- **Merge intelligently**: Add new insights to existing sections or create new sections
- **Maintain markdown structure**: Keep clean ## headers and formatting
- **Build cumulative knowledge**: Enhance rather than replace
- **Time-stamp updates**: Note when new information was added

**Merge Strategies**:

- **append_section**: Add new subsection to existing content
- **update_inline**: Update specific parts while preserving structure
- **replace_section**: Replace a section while keeping others
- **prepend**: Add new content at the beginning

### Phase Generation Rules

When generating phases for a project:

1. Create 2-8 sequential phases based on project complexity
2. Use project context content for guidance (look for timeline and milestone information)
3. Respect task dependencies (dependent tasks in same or later phase)
4. Handle flexible dates intelligently
5. Assign one_off tasks to appropriate phases
6. Keep recurring tasks separate (they span multiple phases)
7. Create backlog for unclear or unassigned tasks
8. **Consider calendar availability**: Suggest realistic phase durations based on user's schedule

### Brain Dump Processing Classification

When parsing brain dumps, classify information into:

- **New Project + Context**: Multi-faceted initiatives requiring rich markdown context
- **Context Updates**: Strategic insights about existing projects to merge into existing context
- **Tasks**: Actionable items with clear completion criteria (include duration estimates)
- **Notes**: Unrefined thoughts, research, insights, or incomplete ideas
- **Phase Guidance**: Timeline or stage information for project execution
- **Scheduling Preferences**: Time-related constraints or preferences

**Project vs Note Decision**:

- **Project**: Big scope, multiple tasks, clear end goal, sustained effort
- **Note**: Single piece of information, one-off thought, no associated tasks

### Calendar-Aware Task Generation

When creating tasks from brain dumps:

1. **Estimate Duration**: Provide realistic time estimates (default 60 min)
2. **Set Time Preferences**: Morning for deep work, afternoon for meetings
3. **Respect Dependencies**: Ensure prerequisite tasks are scheduled first
4. **Buffer Time**: Add buffers between dependent tasks
5. **Recurring Patterns**: Identify habits and set appropriate recurrence

### Daily Brief Generation

When generating briefs, utilize project context and calendar data:

- Extract relevant insights from each project's markdown context
- Look for status updates, challenges, and next actions in context
- Highlight urgent items and deadlines mentioned in context
- Synthesize across projects for strategic insights
- **Include today's schedule**: Show tasks already on calendar
- **Suggest scheduling**: Highlight unscheduled high-priority tasks
- **Time analysis**: Show how time is allocated across projects

### Output Standards

- Always return Markdown-compatible structured output
- Use slug identifiers for consistent project mapping
- Include priority and dependency information for all tasks
- Provide phase assignments with reasoning for tasks
- Maintain voice consistency across all generated content
- Clearly distinguish between context, tasks, phases, and notes in parsing output
- When updating context, preserve existing sections and add new ones thoughtfully
- **Include scheduling metadata**: Duration estimates, time preferences, calendar suggestions

---

## üí° Content Classification Keywords

For automatic parsing and routing:

**Projects**: deliverables, launch, build, create, timeline, phases, tactical, business venture, creative work, initiative, campaign, big scope, multi-faceted

**Context Updates**: vision, goals, strategy, approach, challenges, resources, metrics, milestones, requirements, constraints, schedules, time allocation, status update

**Phases**: stages, milestones, sprints, iterations, cycles, periods, steps, sequence, timeline, roadmap

**Recurring Tasks**: daily, weekly, routine, habit, practice, regular, maintenance, ongoing

**one_off Tasks**: complete, finish, one-time, specific outcome, deadline, deliver, ship

**Calendar/Time**: schedule, book, calendar, meeting, appointment, deadline, start date, timeblock, availability

**Notes**:

- **Insights**: realized, noticed, observation, learned, discovery
- **Research**: found, study, article, source, reference
- **Ideas**: maybe, could, what if, brainstorming, possibility
- **Questions**: how, why, what, when, where, unclear, investigate
- **Reminders**: remember, don't forget, follow up, check on

## üìÖ Calendar Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Scheduling a Project Phase

```typescript
// User brain dumps about launching a new feature
"Need to launch the new analytics dashboard by end of March.
Will need design reviews, implementation, testing, and rollout."

// System creates project with phases and finds optimal schedule
1. Design Review Phase (Mar 1-7)
   - Books 2-hour design review slots
   - Schedules stakeholder feedback sessions

2. Implementation Phase (Mar 8-21)
   - Blocks daily 3-hour deep work sessions
   - Avoids meeting-heavy days

3. Testing Phase (Mar 22-28)
   - Schedules QA sessions
   - Books user testing slots
```

### Example 2: Daily Task Scheduling

```typescript
// Morning brief shows:
"You have 3 unscheduled high-priority tasks today:
1. Review PR #425 (45 min) - Suggested: 9:00-9:45 AM
2. Update investor deck (90 min) - Suggested: 10:00-11:30 AM
3. Team 1:1 prep (30 min) - Suggested: 2:00-2:30 PM

Click to add these to your calendar with one click."
```

### Example 3: Recurring Task Management

```typescript
// User creates habit: "Daily standup with team"
// System:
- Creates recurring calendar event (Mon-Fri, 9:15 AM)
- Links to project context
- Tracks completion automatically
- Adjusts for holidays/PTO
```

## LLM Rules

- Ask me any questions before you get started so we have the right strategy for this.
- If you have confusing or under specified information please stop and ask for clarity before executing on workflows

1. When creating new projects, always generate rich markdown context appropriate to the project type
2. Avoid generic sections - make them specific to what the user is building
3. Use the 5-lens framework internally but translate to natural section names
4. Context should be actionable and inform project execution
5. When updating context, intelligently merge new information with existing sections
6. Notes can evolve into context updates when they become structured
7. Respect the distinction between temporary thoughts (notes) and defining characteristics (context)
8. Always preserve valuable existing context when adding new information
