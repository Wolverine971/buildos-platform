# BuildOS Investor Pitch Deck ‚Äî V2

## Simplified Presentation Document

**Last Updated**: October 9, 2025
**Prepared For**: Investor Meetings & Fundraising
**Round**: Pre-Seed / Seed ($1-5M)

---

## üéØ Deck Philosophy

**Core Thesis**: There's a unique opportunity right now because three things are converging: voice is becoming the natural interface for AI, context engineering is misunderstood, and there's a starving market desperate for solutions.

**Founder-Market Fit**: Two ex-military solopreneurs building what we wish existed. We're solving our own problem and found a community that needs this desperately.

---

## Slide 3: The Problem

### Visual Layout

- **Three-column problem visualization**
- **Icons**: Scattered papers, repetitive loops, disconnected tools

### Copy

**THE PRODUCTIVITY CRISIS**

**Problem 1: Scattered Thoughts Everywhere**

- Ideas lost across 12+ apps (Notion, Apple Notes, Google Docs, notebooks)
- Mental load crushing creative professionals and busy minds
- People spend more time organizing info than executing

**Problem 2: Lost Context with AI**

- Power users paying $20-40/mo for AI tools start from scratch every time
- Every conversation resets ‚Äî no accumulated understanding
- AI can't help if it doesn't know your context

**Problem 3: Tools Don't Match How We Think**

- Complex systems require rigid structure
- "Just talk to ChatGPT" doesn't stick ‚Äî no persistence
- Existing productivity tools designed for how we SHOULD think, not how we ACTUALLY think

### Key Stats

- 70% of knowledge workers feel "overwhelmed" daily (McKinsey, 2024)
- Average professional uses 9+ productivity apps (Asana Survey, 2024)

### Speaker Notes

- Hit the pain: "How many of you copy-paste project context into ChatGPT every day?"
- "The problem isn't people. It's that tools don't match how our brains work."

---

## Slide 4: How People Currently "Solve" This

### Visual Layout

- **Three failing approaches with red X**

### Copy

**THE BROKEN SOLUTIONS LANDSCAPE**

**Approach 1: Talk to LLMs, Export Manually**

- Great AI conversation ‚Üí Export final output
- Lose all context and thinking
- Start over tomorrow, repeat forever
- ‚ùå No compound value

**Approach 2: Complex Productivity Systems**

- Notion templates with 47 fields to fill out
- Rigid frameworks that don't match how you think
- Spend more time organizing than doing
- ‚ùå High friction, low follow-through

**Approach 3: Traditional Calendar Apps**

- Manually schedule everything
- No connection to strategic thinking
- No AI assistance
- ‚ùå Busy but not productive

### The Core Issue

**All existing solutions make you conform to THEIR structure. None of them understand YOU.**

### Speaker Notes

- "Every solution asks: 'How can we make you more organized?' We ask: 'How can we organize the way YOUR brain already works?'"

---

## Slide 5: Our Solution ‚Äî BuildOS

### Visual Layout

- **Center**: Brain dump ‚Üí AI magic ‚Üí Organized system
- **Simple three-step flow**

### Copy

**BUILDOS: WORK WITH HOW YOU THINK**

### The Simple Approach

**Step 1: Capture Your Thoughts**

- Just talk (voice or text) ‚Äî zero structure required
- AI automatically organizes into projects, tasks, and insights
- Frictionless input, always available

**Step 2: AI Builds Your Context**

- Rich project understanding that compounds over time
- One-click copy-paste to any LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Daily briefs keep you aligned without thinking

**Step 3: Turn Thoughts Into Action**

- One-click calendar scheduling
- Smart task suggestions based on your patterns
- Daily notifications that actually help

### How It Works In Practice

**Brain Dump**
"I need to launch the new feature, talk to investors, and fix the billing bug"

**AI Organizes**
‚Üí 3 projects created with context
‚Üí 8 tasks extracted and categorized
‚Üí Calendar slots suggested

**You Execute**
‚Üí Click to schedule tasks
‚Üí Get daily briefs
‚Üí Ask AI about any project (full context ready)

### The Magic

**We're not passively working in the background. We're responding to you as you talk, helping you synthesize your raw thoughts.**

### Speaker Notes

- Demo if possible: "Let me show you a 60-second brain dump becoming scheduled action"
- "This isn't an AI assistant doing work FOR you. It's AI organizing so YOU can work better."

---

## Slide 6: The Product in Action

### Visual Layout

- **Screenshot/demo of actual product**
- **Three features highlighted**

### Copy

**BUILDOS: YOUR HOME BASE FOR STAYING ORGANIZED**

**Feature 1: Brain Dump Anything**

- Voice or text input, zero friction
- AI extracts projects, tasks, context automatically
- Works how your brain works

**Feature 2: Task Workbench**

## Slide 8: The Big Reveal ‚Äî Why There's an Opportunity Right Now

### Visual Layout

- **Three circles converging into center point**
- **Timeline showing "NOW" as the convergence moment**

### Copy

**WHY THERE'S A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW**

**Three things are converging that create a window for us:**

---

### 1. Voice is Becoming Habit-Forming

**What's happening:**

- Voice AI is having its breakthrough moment (Advanced Voice Mode, Gemini Live)
- Talking to AI is becoming as natural as texting
- It's habit-forming ‚Äî once people start, they don't stop

**Why it matters:**

- Humans think faster than they type
- Voice lowers friction to near-zero
- This changes what's possible for productivity tools

**Our advantage:**

- We're building voice-native brain dumping from day one
- Not retrofitting voice onto old architecture

---

### 2. Context Engineering is Misunderstood

**What most people don't understand:**

- Everyone's focused on what AI agents can DO
- But AI can't help without the right CONTEXT
- Context engineering ‚Äî understanding the user first ‚Äî is way more important than agents taking actions

**What we're doing differently:**

- We focus on understanding the user FIRST, then offering advice
- We engineer context at a granular level ‚Äî every brain dump compounds
- This enables us to make the AI extremely tailored to each user

**Why it matters:**

- This is the insight everyone else is missing
- You need properly engineered context for AI to truly help with complex work
- This is what creates our moat

---

### 3. A Starving Market Getting Bigger

**Who needs this:**

- ADHD community is desperate for solutions that work how they think
- As attention spans get shorter, more people face similar challenges
- Social media and constant notifications have created "ADHD-like" symptoms in everyone

**Why it matters:**

- We're not creating demand ‚Äî we're fulfilling desperate need
- Starting with ADHD gives us a passionate beachhead
- Market is expanding as attention economy intensifies

**The numbers:**

- 15M+ adults diagnosed with ADHD in US
- 200M+ knowledge workers globally feeling overwhelmed
- Market growing every year as attention spans shrink

---

### The Convergence

**Voice makes input frictionless**

- **Context engineering (done right) makes AI actually useful**
- # **A growing, desperate market**
    **A unique window for BuildOS**

### Why This Creates Opportunity

**We're not saying we're the best. We're saying:**

- There's a pattern emerging that others haven't connected yet
- We have a 12-18 month window before everyone figures this out
- We're building at the convergence point of these three trends

### Speaker Notes

- "This isn't about us being smarter. It's about timing and insight."
- "Voice + Context Engineering + Starving Market = opportunity"
- "In 3 years, everyone will talk about context engineering. We're doing it now."

---

## Slide 9: Why Now ‚Äî The Timing Window

### Visual Layout

- **Timeline showing the window**
- **Before (too early) | NOW (perfect) | After (too late)**

### Copy

**THE 12-18 MONTH WINDOW**

### Why Now is the Right Time

**Too Early (2020-2022)**

- ‚ùå AI not capable enough (GPT-3 era)
- ‚ùå Voice recognition not natural
- ‚ùå People still believed in complex productivity systems

**Just Right (2025 NOW)**

- ‚úÖ AI can truly organize thoughts (GPT-4, Claude 3.5)
- ‚úÖ Voice is natural and fast (Advanced Voice Mode, Gemini Live)
- ‚úÖ Attention spans collapsing (everyone needs frictionless tools)
- ‚úÖ Productivity tool fatigue creates openness
- ‚úÖ Context engineering not yet understood by incumbents

**Too Late (2027+)**

- ‚ùå Incumbents will have figured out context engineering
- ‚ùå Market will be crowded
- ‚ùå First-mover advantage lost

### What We're Building NOW

**1. User Context Moat** (compounds over time)

- Every brain dump makes switching harder
- Context accumulation is the lock-in

**2. Community Trust** (can't be bought)

- ADHD community loyalty is fierce
- Founder authenticity matters

**3. AI-Native Architecture** (requires ground-up rebuild)

- Incumbents trapped in old data models
- We're built for AI from day 1

### The Window

**Our goal**: 1,000-2,500 paying users before competitors catch up

### Speaker Notes

- "If Notion rebuilds from scratch for AI, how long does that take? 2 years minimum."
- "We have 12-18 months before this becomes obvious to everyone."

### Copy

**THE BUILDOS VISION: A DIFFERENT PATH TO THE SAME DREAM**

_Everyone wants Jarvis. We think we know how to get there._

---

### Where We're Heading

**Short-term (1-3 years)**
_Get a Foothold in the ADHD Community_

- Build a tool that's truly tailored to how ADHD minds work
- Earn fierce loyalty from a community desperate for solutions
- Become the default productivity tool for neurodivergent thinkers
- **Goal**: Be the ADHD productivity tool

**Mid-term (3-5 years)**
_Become the Context Checkpoint for All AI Agents_

- BuildOS becomes THE MCP (Model Context Protocol) for user understanding
- When any AI agent needs to know what you're working on ‚Üí it pings BuildOS
- When any AI agent needs project context to help you ‚Üí it pings BuildOS
- We become the source of truth for user context across the AI ecosystem

**Why this matters:**

- AI agents can DO things, but they need to UNDERSTAND you first
- BuildOS becomes the infrastructure layer for human-AI collaboration
- We're not just a productivity tool ‚Äî we're the context layer for the AI age

**Long-term (5-10 years)**
_Enable the Creativity Renaissance_

- Time from idea to execution approaches zero
- We've laid the framework for a true Cortana/Jarvis AI
- "Able to do what Siri wanted to do" ‚Äî but we got there differently
- AI that's always with you, ready to help, because it actually understands you

**How we're getting there:**

- **Right market** (ADHD beachhead ‚Üí everyone)
- **Right strategy** (context engineering first, actions second)
- **Right timing** (voice + context + desperate need converging now)

---

### The World We're Creating

**A world where:**

- The time from "I have an idea" to "I shipped it" is measured in hours, not months
- AI doesn't just execute commands ‚Äî it partners with you because it understands you
- ADHD is recognized as a superpower for creativity and entrepreneurship
- Every human has access to a cognitive copilot that knows them deeply

### Why This Path Works

**Everyone else is trying to build Jarvis by making AI do more things.**

**We're building Jarvis by making AI understand you first.**

- Start with understanding (context engineering)
- Become the checkpoint for all AI agents (infrastructure play)
- Enable the creativity renaissance (cultural shift)

**Different path. Same destination. Better odds.**

---

### What Success Looks Like

**10 years from now:**

- 10M+ people use BuildOS daily as their context home base
- Every major AI agent pings BuildOS for user context
- "Brain dump" is a verb like "Google it"
- We've enabled a creativity renaissance: 100,000 books, 10,000 companies, 1M creative projects
- People finally have the Jarvis/Cortana AI they've always wanted

**Not just a productivity tool. Infrastructure for the AI age.**

---

### Join Us

**This is bigger than organizing tasks.**

This is about:

- Building the missing infrastructure layer for human-AI collaboration
- Empowering neurodivergent minds to change the world
- Creating the creativity renaissance that shortens idea-to-execution time to near-zero
- Laying the groundwork for the AI assistant humanity deserves

**The revolution started with 83 beta users.**

**It scales with you.**

### Speaker Notes

- "Everyone wants Jarvis. Apple tried with Siri. It didn't work. We think we know why."
- "They tried to make AI do things before making AI understand people. We're doing it the other way."
- "Short-term: ADHD tool. Mid-term: Context infrastructure. Long-term: Jarvis. That's the path."
- "We're not building a company to flip. We're building the infrastructure layer for the AI age."
