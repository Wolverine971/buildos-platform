## What is BuildOS?

BuildOS is an AI-native productivity platform that transforms unstructured thoughts into organized projects and actionable plans. We're starting with the underserved ADHD market (15M+ adults) and expanding to all overwhelmed knowledge workers.

### Core Innovation

**Brain Dump → AI Organization → Execution**

Users speak or type freely (zero structure required), AI automatically extracts projects, tasks, and context, then one-click calendar scheduling bridges thoughts to action.

### The Hidden Insight

**Context Engineering > AI Agents**

While competitors focus on AI agents that take actions, we're building the context engine that makes AI actually useful. You need to understand the user first before you can help them.

### Key Metrics

- **83 signups** in 3 weeks at **$3 CAC** (Maryland test market)
- **77% retention** vs **11% industry standard** for ADHD tools (7x better)
- Minimal marketing spend (proves product demand)

---

## One-Sentence Descriptions

### Version A: Human-Centered (RECOMMENDED FOR MOST)

**BuildOS helps people with ADHD and overwhelmed minds turn scattered thoughts into organized action through AI that works how their brain actually works, not how it should work.**

**Use when**: General accelerators, mission-driven funds, most applications

**Why it works**: Empathetic, implies founder-market fit, addresses massive underserved market, scalable beyond ADHD.

---

### Version B: Bold/Visionary

**BuildOS is the context infrastructure for human-AI collaboration, starting with ADHD productivity and scaling to become the operating system for how everyone works with AI.**

**Use when**: Thesis-driven funds, infrastructure investors, AI-focused accelerators

**Why it works**: Positions as infrastructure play, appeals to long-term vision, implies massive TAM.

---

### Version C: Technical/Precise

**BuildOS uses AI to automatically organize stream-of-consciousness brain dumps into structured projects with accumulated context, solving the LLM context repetition problem while bridging thoughts to calendar-scheduled action.**

**Use when**: Technical accelerators, developer tools funds, AI/ML investors

**Why it works**: Specific technical value, addresses known pain point, implies product sophistication.

---

### Version D: Conservative/Professional

**BuildOS is an AI-native productivity platform that transforms unstructured thoughts into organized projects and actionable plans, starting with the underserved ADHD market.**

**Use when**: Traditional accelerators (Y Combinator style), enterprise-focused VCs

**Why it works**: Clear value prop, market focus, implies scalability beyond beachhead.

---

## Three-Sentence Descriptions

### Version A: Timing + Opportunity (RECOMMENDED)

**BuildOS is the first productivity tool designed for the LLM era, built on an insight everyone's missing: AI can't help without understanding you first. While competitors build agents to do tasks, we're building the context engine that makes AI actually useful. We're starting with ADHD users who are desperate for this (83 signups at $3 CAC, 77% retention), and we have a 12-18 month window before incumbents figure out context engineering.**

**Use when**: Opportunistic investors, timing-focused funds, contrarian thinkers

**Why it works**: Contrarian insight, timing window creates urgency, strong early validation, competitive moat.

---

### Version B: Traction + Value

**BuildOS solves three problems: scattered thoughts across 12+ apps, constantly repeating context to ChatGPT/Claude, and plans that never get executed. Users brain dump anything, AI organizes it into rich project context that compounds over time, and one-click scheduling turns plans into calendar-blocked action. We've validated with 83 signups at $3 CAC and 77% retention in a market segment with 11% industry standard.**

**Use when**: Growth-stage accelerators, metrics-driven investors, traction-focused programs

**Why it works**: Multiple clear pain points, traction proof, exceptional retention metric, unit economics.

---

### Version C: Bold/Infrastructure Vision

**BuildOS is building the context layer for the AI age. We start by solving the hardest problem—productivity for ADHD minds—by letting users brain dump freely while AI handles all organization. As context compounds over time, BuildOS becomes the source of truth that all AI agents ping to understand you, creating the infrastructure layer for true human-AI collaboration.**

**Use when**: Thesis-driven funds, platform investors, AI infrastructure accelerators

**Why it works**: Big vision, technical moat (context accumulation), positions as platform not point solution.

---

### Version D: Conservative/Market-Focused

**BuildOS transforms scattered thoughts into organized action through AI-powered brain dumps. Users speak or type freely, and our AI automatically extracts projects, tasks, and context—then bridges that to execution through one-click calendar scheduling and daily briefs. We're starting with the ADHD community (15M+ adults desperate for tools that work how they think) and expanding to all overwhelmed knowledge workers.**

**Use when**: Traditional accelerators, risk-averse investors, B2B-focused programs

**Why it works**: Clear problem-solution-market, validates with numbers, shows expansion path.

## 30-Second Elevator Pitches

### Version A: Founder Story (RECOMMENDED)

"I'm DJ. I'm a former Marine Scout Sniper turned YC-backed engineer with ADHD. Every productivity tool made me feel broken—they were designed for how I should think, not how I actually think. So I built BuildOS: you brain dump anything—voice or text, completely unstructured—AI organizes it automatically, and one-click scheduling turns plans into action. My co-founder Zach has ADHD too and believes it's actually a superpower when you have the right tools. We're starting with 15M ADHD adults who are desperate for this, and we've proven it: 83 signups at $3 CAC with 77% retention—7x better than the industry standard. We're raising $1M to scale to 1,000 paying users and expand beyond ADHD to all overwhelmed professionals."

**Delivery notes**:

- Make eye contact when saying "feel broken" (vulnerability builds trust)
- Smile when mentioning Zach's "superpower" belief (shows team chemistry)
- Confident close on the ask

**Use when**: Personality-driven accelerators, founder-focused programs, storytelling-friendly contexts

---

### Version B: Bold/Visionary

"Everyone's building AI agents to do tasks, but they're missing the key insight: AI can't help without understanding you first. I'm DJ, and I built BuildOS as the context engine that solves this. You brain dump your thoughts—completely unstructured—AI organizes them, and that context compounds over time, making every AI interaction better. We're starting with the hardest market—ADHD productivity—because if we can solve for chaotic minds, we can solve for everyone. We've proven it: 83 signups at $3 CAC, 77% retention, 7x the industry standard. Long-term vision: BuildOS becomes the context checkpoint that all AI agents ping to understand you. We're building the infrastructure layer for human-AI collaboration, and we're raising $1M to get there."

**Delivery notes**:

- Start with contrarian insight (hooks investor curiosity)
- Pause after "key insight"
- Emphasize "infrastructure layer" as the end game

**Use when**: Thesis-driven accelerators, AI-focused programs, platform investors

---

### Version C: Conservative/Traction-Focused

"I'm DJ, I built BuildOS because I had ADHD and every productivity tool failed me. BuildOS lets you brain dump your thoughts—voice or text, zero structure—and AI automatically organizes everything into projects, tasks, and phases. Then we bridge that to execution with one-click calendar scheduling. We validated with 83 signups at $3 CAC in 3 weeks with 77% retention, 7x better than the industry standard for ADHD tools. We're starting with the desperate ADHD market—15 million adults in the US—and expanding to all overwhelmed knowledge workers. We're raising $1M to get to 500-1,000 paying users and validate product-market fit."

**Delivery notes**:

- Pause after "failed me" (builds empathy)
- Emphasize "77% retention, 7x better"
- End with confident ask

**Use when**: Traditional accelerators, data-driven investors, quick introductions

---

### Version D: Problem-First

"Do you know that feeling when you have a great idea, but by the time you open Notion to write it down, you've forgotten half of it? Or when you spend 10 minutes explaining your project to ChatGPT for the third time this week? That's the problem I built BuildOS to solve. I have ADHD, and I was drowning in scattered thoughts across 12 different apps. BuildOS lets you brain dump everything—voice or text, zero structure—and AI automatically organizes it into projects and tasks. Then we bridge that to execution with one-click calendar scheduling. We've validated with ADHD users first: 83 signups at $3 CAC, 77% retention—7x better than industry standard. Now we're expanding to all overwhelmed professionals who feel the same pain."

**Delivery notes**:

- Start with relatable question (builds instant connection)
- Use "you" language throughout (makes it personal)
- "I was drowning" - vulnerability is powerful

**Use when**: Problem-focused investors, empathy-driven accelerators, healthcare/mental health funds

---

## 2-Minute Elevator Pitches

### Version A: Traditional/Traction-Focused (RECOMMENDED FOR MOST)

"I'm DJ, CEO and co-founder of BuildOS. Quick question: how many of you use ChatGPT or Claude for work? [Wait for response] And how many of you find yourself copy-pasting the same project context into every conversation? [Nods] Right. That's exactly the problem we're solving.

I'm a former Marine Scout Sniper turned YC-backed engineer with ADHD. Every productivity tool I tried—Notion, Asana, Todoist—made me feel broken. They were designed for how I should think, not how I actually think. So I built BuildOS.

Here's how it works: You brain dump your thoughts—voice or text, completely unstructured. Maybe you're thinking about three different projects at once, maybe you're jumping between ideas. Doesn't matter. Our AI automatically extracts projects, tasks, and context from the chaos. Then we bridge that to execution: one-click calendar scheduling and daily briefs that keep you on track.

The key innovation is context accumulation. Every brain dump makes your projects richer. Copy that context into any LLM, and suddenly you're not starting from scratch every time. It compounds.

We started with the ADHD market—15 million adults in the US who are desperate for tools that work how they think—and we've proven the model. In our first Maryland test market: 83 signups at $3 CAC in 3 weeks. But here's the kicker: 77% retention. The industry standard for ADHD productivity tools is 11%. We're 7x better.

Why? Because we're not trying to fix people. We're meeting them where they are.

My co-founder Zach has ADHD too. He ran 100+ marketing campaigns for solopreneurs and was actively looking for a tool like this when I showed him BuildOS. He believes ADHD is actually a superpower when you have the right infrastructure.

The opportunity is massive. We're starting with ADHD, but the market is everyone who feels overwhelmed: 200M+ knowledge workers globally. As attention spans shrink, more people need frictionless tools.

We're raising $1M to validate product-market fit over the next 12-18 months. Goal: 500-1,000 paying users at $20/month. That gives us $10-20K MRR and proves we can scale.

Long-term vision: BuildOS becomes the operating system for how everyone works with AI. But first, we nail ADHD productivity.

Happy to answer questions."

**Delivery notes**:

- Start with interactive question (engages audience)
- Pause after "I felt broken" (vulnerability)
- Emphasize "77% vs 11%" metric strongly
- Confident but humble close

**Use when**: Traditional accelerators, conservative investors, most investor meetings

---

### Version B: Bold/Thesis-Driven (FOR PROGRESSIVE ACCELERATORS)

"Quick question: What's the most valuable company in AI going to be? [Pause] Most people say it's whoever builds the best AI agents. We think they're wrong.

I'm DJ, co-founder of BuildOS, and we're building on a different insight: AI can't help you without understanding you first. Everyone's focused on what AI can do. We're focused on what AI needs to know.

Let me explain with a personal story. I have ADHD. I'm a former Marine Scout Sniper turned YC-backed engineer. Every productivity tool I tried—Notion, Asana, everything—failed me. Not because they weren't powerful. Because they were designed for neurotypical brains that think linearly. My brain doesn't work that way.

So I built BuildOS. You brain dump your thoughts—voice or text, zero structure—and AI organizes everything automatically. Projects, tasks, phases, context. All extracted from your chaos. Then we bridge that to execution with one-click calendar scheduling.

But here's the key insight: every brain dump makes your context richer. It compounds. We're not just organizing thoughts—we're engineering context at a granular level. That context is what makes AI actually useful.

Think about it: You pay $20/month for ChatGPT Pro. How many times do you copy-paste the same project background into every conversation? BuildOS solves that. Copy your accumulated project context, paste it into any LLM, and suddenly you're not starting from scratch.

We're starting with the hardest market: ADHD productivity. Fifteen million adults who've been failed by every tool. If we can solve for the most chaotic minds, we can solve for everyone. And we've proven it: 83 signups at $3 CAC, 77% retention in a market with 11% industry standard.

But here's why there's a unique opportunity right now: Three things are converging.

One: Voice is becoming natural. Advanced Voice Mode, Gemini Live—talking to AI is finally frictionless. That's our input mechanism.

Two: Context engineering is misunderstood. Everyone's building agents to take actions, but they're missing that AI needs to understand you first. We're doing context engineering properly.

Three: There's a desperate, growing market. ADHD diagnoses up 42%. Attention spans collapsing. More people need tools that work how brains actually function.

We have a 12-18 month window before incumbents figure this out. Notion can't rebuild their architecture easily. We're AI-native from day one.

Long-term vision: BuildOS becomes the context checkpoint for all AI agents. When any AI needs to know what you're working on, it pings BuildOS. We're not a productivity tool—we're the infrastructure layer for human-AI collaboration.

We're raising $1M to get to 500-1,000 paying users and validate that the market wants this beyond ADHD. That's our product-market fit signal.

Then we scale. This is bigger than organizing tasks. This is building the missing infrastructure for how humans and AI work together.

Questions?"

**Delivery notes**:

- Start with provocative question (engages critical thinking)
- Emphasize "context engineering" as the insight
- Build to infrastructure vision progressively
- Confident, visionary tone throughout

**Use when**: Thesis-driven funds, AI/infrastructure investors, visionary programs

### Version C: Founder Journey (HIGHLY PERSONAL)

"I want to tell you about the moment I realized I had to build BuildOS.

It was 2 AM. I was staring at my computer screen, looking at my seventh productivity app of the year. Notion. I'd spent three hours setting up the perfect system—templates, databases, automations. I went to bed proud of my organization.

The next morning, I couldn't bring myself to open it. Too much friction. Too many fields to fill. Too much structure for a brain that doesn't think in straight lines.

I'm DJ. I'm a former Marine Scout Sniper with ADHD. In the Marines, I could handle extreme pressure, make life-or-death decisions, execute complex missions. But managing my personal projects? I felt like a failure.

That's not a me problem. That's a tool problem.

Every productivity app is designed by neurotypical people for neurotypical brains. They assume you think linearly. They require structure up front. They make you conform to their system.

For someone with ADHD, that's hell. Our brains jump between ideas. We think in networks, not lists. We need to dump our thoughts first and organize later.

So I built BuildOS. You open it, you brain dump—voice or text, completely unstructured. Maybe you're thinking about three projects at once. Doesn't matter. AI extracts it all: projects, tasks, context. Then it bridges that to execution: one-click scheduling, daily briefs.

My co-founder Zach has ADHD too. When I showed him the prototype, he said something that stuck with me: 'ADHD isn't a disorder. It's a superpower when you have the right tools.'

We're starting with the ADHD community because they need this most desperately. Fifteen million adults in the US who've been told their whole lives that they're broken. We're telling them they're not. The tools were broken.

And we're proving it works. First test market in Maryland: 83 signups at $3 CAC. Seventy-seven percent are still using it. The industry standard for ADHD tools is 11% retention. We're 7x better.

But here's what excites me most: This isn't just an ADHD tool. It's a tool for how brains actually work in the AI age. As attention spans shrink and information overwhelm increases, more people feel like they have ADHD symptoms. Our market is growing.

The bigger vision: Everyone's building AI agents to do tasks. But AI can't help without understanding you first. BuildOS is the context layer. The more you use it, the richer your context becomes. Copy that into any AI tool—ChatGPT, Claude, whatever—and suddenly you're not repeating yourself.

Long-term, BuildOS becomes the source of truth that all AI agents ping to understand you. We're building infrastructure, not just a productivity app.

We're raising $1M to get to 500-1,000 paying users over the next 12-18 months. That's our product-market fit signal. Then we scale beyond ADHD to everyone who's overwhelmed.

I didn't build BuildOS to start a company. I built it because I needed it to exist. The fact that millions of others need it too? That's the opportunity.

I'm happy to answer any questions."

**Delivery notes**:

- Start with vulnerable story (builds immediate connection)
- Use pauses effectively after emotional beats
- "I felt like a failure" - own the vulnerability
- Build from personal pain to universal opportunity
- End with authentic motivation (not money-driven)

**Use when**: Founder-focused accelerators, empathy-driven programs, storytelling contexts

## Common Questions & Responses

### "Why can't Notion just add this feature?"

"Notion's architecture is built for manual structured input. To do what we do—real-time AI organization from unstructured brain dumps—they'd need to rebuild from scratch. That's 2+ years minimum with their current architecture. We have a window."

---

### "What's your moat?"

"Three moats: First, context accumulation creates switching costs—the longer you use BuildOS, the more valuable your accumulated context becomes. Second, community trust with ADHD users—authenticity can't be copied when both founders have ADHD and use the product daily. Third, AI-native architecture gives us 12-18 months before incumbents catch up."

---

### "How do you expand beyond ADHD?"

"ADHD is the beachhead because the pain is most acute—they've been failed by every tool. But everyone with overwhelming jobs experiences similar symptoms. We expand to knowledge workers, consultants, founders—anyone juggling multiple complex projects. As attention spans shrink globally, the market is actually growing to meet us."

---

### "Why will people pay for this?"

"They're already paying $20/month for ChatGPT and $10-15/month for Notion. We combine and improve both: better AI collaboration through persistent context plus frictionless organization. The value prop is clear, and our $20/month price point captures value from both use cases."

---

### "What if OpenAI builds this into ChatGPT?"

"OpenAI is building horizontal infrastructure—general AI for everyone. We're building vertical depth for productivity. Plus, we integrate with all LLMs, not just OpenAI—we're model-agnostic. We're the context layer, they're the reasoning layer. These are complementary, not competitive."

---

### "How do you handle privacy concerns with ADHD health data?"

"We don't collect medical information or diagnoses. We're a productivity tool that happens to work well for ADHD minds. Users self-identify, but we're not processing protected health information. Standard security practices: encryption at rest and in transit, SOC 2 Type II on our roadmap."

---

### "What's your customer acquisition strategy beyond ads?"

"We're building community-first. ADHD users are vocal advocates when they find tools that work. Our 77% retention drives word-of-mouth. Long-term: content marketing around productivity and AI collaboration, partnerships with ADHD communities, and organic growth as we expand to general knowledge workers."

---

### "How do you monetize the free tier?"

"We're launching with a simple freemium model: free tier for basic brain dumps and project organization, $20/month pro tier for unlimited projects, daily briefs, calendar integration, and priority AI processing. Free tier is lead generation; power users convert to paid."

---

## Key Differentiators

### Against Notion

"Notion is beautiful interior decorating for jail cells. They're designed for manual input with AI bolted on. We're AI-native from day one—built for brain dumps, not structured data entry."

### Against Asana/Monday.com

"They're corporate compliance software designed to make you a better employee. We're built to make you a better creator. They make you conform to their structure. We conform to how your brain actually works."

### Against ChatGPT

"ChatGPT is incredibly powerful, but you start from scratch every conversation. BuildOS builds context that compounds—every brain dump makes your projects richer. Copy that context into ChatGPT and suddenly you're not repeating yourself."

### Against Other ADHD Tools

"Most ADHD tools are medication reminders, timers, or focus aids. We're building the complete infrastructure for how ADHD minds organize, think, and create. We're not managing symptoms; we're amplifying strengths."

---

## Delivery Best Practices

### General Tips

1. **Start strong**: First 10 seconds set the tone. Use a hook (question, insight, or vulnerability)
2. **Pause strategically**: After key emotional beats or important metrics (especially the 77% vs 11%)
3. **Show confidence**: Especially on retention metrics—this is exceptional and you should own it
4. **Be authentic**: Don't oversell. Humble confidence wins more trust than bravado
5. **End with clear ask**: Always close with specific fundraising amount and goals

### Body Language

- **Open posture**: Avoid crossing arms, face audience directly
- **Eye contact**: Especially during emotional moments (vulnerability) and key metrics (credibility)
- **Hand gestures**: Use to emphasize key points (77% retention, 7x better)
- **Smile when appropriate**: When talking about team chemistry, user wins, or vision

### Voice Modulation

- **Vary pace**: Slow down for important points, speed up for energy/excitement
- **Volume changes**: Louder for excitement (traction), softer for vulnerability (personal story)
- **Emphasis words**: Key numbers (77%, $3 CAC, 83 signups, $1M raise, 7x better)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Rushing through metrics (people need time to process 77% vs 11%)
- ❌ Over-explaining the technology (focus on value, not implementation)
- ❌ Apologizing for traction level (83 signups at $3 CAC is strong validation)
- ❌ Forgetting to mention the fundraising ask
- ❌ Speaking in jargon (say "brain dump" not "unstructured data ingestion")
