# Lulu Cheng Meservey Communications Strategy Cheat Sheet

## üéØ Core Principle

**"Comms is the final bastion of human ability"** - The ability to persuade, win over, and make other people fall in love will remain uniquely human, even as AI advances.

---

## 1. Why Comms is Having a Moment (0:50)

### Key Insights:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Founders see that companies with the most "aura" and strongest cults are winning
- **"Aura" = Good Communication**: You can't have aura if you can't describe what your company does clearly
- **Winners Have Strong Reputations**: People with stronger reputations that others think highly of are the winners

### Actionable Takeaways:

- Build reputation holistically, not through tricks
- Start with your mission (what you're trying to achieve), not with wanting people to love you
- Determine what people need to know about you that's both TRUE and USEFUL for your project

---

## 2. Breaking Through the Noise (3:43)

### The Framework:

**"What and How > Where"**

- Everyone asks "which podcast can we go on?"
- Nobody asks "how do we get people interested once we're there?"

### The Likability Factor:

- If people like you in their gut, they will help you succeed in their own minds
- They'll rationalize why what they heard was compelling
- Pure honest conviction and confidence are magnetic

### How to Build Magnetic Conviction:

- Have complete confidence that what you're doing is right and inevitable
- Simply share that confidence with people
- Let them feel it emanating from you
- This is what makes people leave their jobs to work with you

## 3. What Makes a Great Story (6:30)

### The Universal Story Arc:

**Every great story has:**

1. A problem
2. A resolution

### Story Physics:

- "What goes up must come down"
- "Pride comes before the fall"
- "Darkest before the dawn"
- People assume every story MUST have this arc

### Your Job as a Founder:

- You don't get to choose whether there's an arc
- You DO get to choose where people think you are on the arc
- Help people understand:
  - Where you are on the curve
  - Where the arc is headed

### The Two Positions:

1. **Past the apex** ‚Üí People assume you're coming down
2. **Hitting the knee of the curve** ‚Üí People assume greatness awaits

**Pro tip**: Companies need multiple arcs - create new tension points for new stories

---

## 4. Creating Story Arcs (9:58)

### The Homeostatic Set Point Theory:

People have an assumption of the level of celebration/success you deserve

**Two Key Variables:**

1. Where SHOULD you be valued? (the correct set point)
2. Where ARE you now relative to that?

### The Underrated/Overrated Dynamic:

- **Underrated = Compliment** (people want to bring you up)
- **Overrated = Insult** (people want to bring you down)
- People feel smart when they identify discrepancies

### How to Position Yourself as Underrated:

1. Set an ambitious but believable endpoint
2. Show you're not there yet
3. Let people feel they're discovering your true value

### Mission Statement Mistakes:

- **Too lofty/generic** ‚Üí No meaning, no set point
- **Too current/achievable** ‚Üí "You did it, now what?"

**Solution**: Choose timeless, ambitious, specific missions

---

## 5. Flow and Stock Framework (17:29)

### Three Overlapping Circles for Positioning:

**Circle 1: Things that are TRUE**

- Facts about your company
- Your background
- Your achievements

**Circle 2: Things that are RELEVANT/INTERESTING**

- What excites people today
- Current market conditions
- Trending topics

**Circle 3: Things that are STRATEGIC/HELPFUL**

- What advances your business
- What attracts customers/talent
- What differentiates you

### The Sweet Spot:

Focus on the overlap of all three circles when deciding what to communicate

### Example Analysis:

- **True + Relevant but Not Helpful**: Don't mention (e.g., a feature you're not ready to offer)
- **True + Helpful but Not Relevant**: Save for later
- **All Three**: This is your core messaging

---

## 6. All Press is Good Press? (20:29)

### The Critical Question:

"Is what I'm saying useful for the business I'm trying to build?"

### Case Study Framework:

- Viral content that contradicts your need for trust ‚Üí Bad
- Viral content that aligns with your business model ‚Üí Good

### Key Consideration:

It's harder to pivot WHO people think you are as a person than WHAT your business does

### Trust vs. Distribution Trade-off:

- Can you change your narrative over time? Possible but hard
- Personality and trust accrue differently than business models
- If you bait-and-switch on personality, you lose

---

## 7. Leaning into Authenticity (23:25)

### The Three Layers of You:

1. **True Authentic Self** - Complete picture (known to family/God)
2. **Personal Relationships** - What friends/colleagues know
3. **Public Persona** - Compressed, refracted version

### Authenticity Strategy:

- Work within the confines of what's true about you
- Choose which authentic traits to emphasize
- Amplify traits for public consumption
- Different archetypes work for different leaders

### Archetype Examples:

- **Technical Genius** ‚Üí "In the lab cooking something amazing"
- **Empathetic Leader** ‚Üí Warm, fuzzy, supportive
- Don't fake an archetype that isn't you

### The Repetition Reality:

- Say important things 10x personally for people to hear it 1-2x
- Internal team gets sick of messages before external world hears them once

---

## 8. Word Choice Mastery (28:10)

### Core Principle:

"Each word should be load-bearing"

### Sound Psychology:

- **S's and I's** ‚Üí Sinister, sharp feeling
- **O's and B's** ‚Üí Rounder, friendlier feeling
- Word sound influences how people feel about concepts

### Framing Through Metaphor:

**Crime Example:**

- "Crime ravaging like a wild beast" ‚Üí Military response
- "Crime is a disease spreading" ‚Üí Social worker response

### Psychological Framing:

**Prospect Theory Application:**

- People need 2x upside to take same risk as avoiding downside
- Frame your pitch as saving them from loss, not gaining upside

### The Right Sales Pitch:

‚ùå "What you have is mid, ours is better"
‚úÖ "Your current solution is becoming obsolete, competitors are moving, we'll cement your leadership"

---

## 9. Impact on Recruiting (35:09)

### The Napoleon Principles:

**1. Give a Cause Bigger Than the Task**

- Not "take this bridge" but "40,000 years of history are looking down on you"
- Create mandate of heaven for your company

**2. Brand Everything**

- "Army of Britain" ‚Üí "The Grand Army" (avoiding failed conquest branding)
- "The guys who get shot" ‚Üí "Les Braves" (the men without fear)

**3. Be One of Them**

- Napoleon was "the little corporal" - aimed cannons himself
- Modern equivalent: CEO with hands on keyboard, not just on podcasts

**4. Shared Experience**

- Same food, same conditions
- Old gray jacket, not fancy uniforms

### Modern Tech Applications:

**Leaders Who Get It:**

- **Brian Chesky**: Recruits personally, could do the jobs himself
- **Dylan Field**: Everyone wants to see him win
- **Joe Gebbia**: In Figma designing by hand
- **Toby (Shopify)**: Chief AI tinkerer, shows what he built
- **Scott Wu (Cognition)**: Peer to engineers, not above them

### Key Principle:

"If founder leaves, it's not the same company"

## 10. The Business of Comms (42:48)

### Learning Philosophy:

- Go deep in specific companies to truly understand
- "Necessity is the mother of invention"
- Build general theory through multiple deep dives

### Strategic Approach:

- Quality over quantity (fewer clients, deeper work)
- Power law applies - some need much deeper engagement
- Goal: Change how entire industry does comms

### Industry Impact:

"If each company gets better at making their case, all of tech grows faster"

---

## 11. Comms Predictions (45:48)

### High Confidence Predictions:

1. **Comms will remain uniquely human** - AI can't replicate human persuasion
2. **Narrative completion desire is immutable** - Humans need story resolution

### Low Confidence Areas:

- Form factors (video? podcasts? what's next?)
- Role of traditional media
- Distribution channels

### The Innovation Imperative:

- **Must outrun your own good ideas**
- Once everyone copies your launch style, it becomes cringe
- Find narrative alpha before others catch up
- "If I don't find new frontier, I've lost my alpha"

---

## 12. Tech & Media Relationship (48:18)

### Current State:

- Moving from combative to collaborative
- Fresh blood in tech journalism
- Media becoming more relevant again

### Going Direct Doesn't Mean:

- Boycotting media
- Being dependent on others
- Only self-publishing

### Going Direct DOES Mean:

- Creating self-sufficiency
- Choosing when to collaborate
- Not being "up the creek" if media won't cover you

### Future Dynamic:

- AI (ChatGPT/Claude) makes media coverage more valuable
- One article solidifies what scattered tweets can't
- New equilibrium of collaboration emerging
