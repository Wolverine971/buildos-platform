Your daily brief is Build OS's most powerful featureâ€”a personalized intelligence report that understands your projects, goals, and working style to provide targeted guidance for each day. Unlike generic productivity advice, your daily brief is tailored specifically to your current context and priorities.

Learning to effectively use and customize your daily briefs transforms them from simple summaries into strategic intelligence that drives better decisions and focused action.
