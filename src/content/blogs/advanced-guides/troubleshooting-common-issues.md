Even the most well-designed systems occasionally need troubleshooting. Build OS is designed to be robust and reliable, but understanding how to diagnose and resolve common issues will help you maintain peak productivity and confidence in your personal operating system.

This guide covers the most frequently encountered issues, their solutions, and preventive measures to keep your Build OS running smoothly.

## General Diagnostic Approach

### The 3-Step Diagnostic Process

**Step 1: Isolate the Issue**

- Is this affecting one project or all projects?
- Did this start after a specific action or change?
- Can you reproduce the issue consistently?
- Is this a data issue, interface issue, or workflow issue?

**Step 2: Check System Status**

- Are all integrations (calendar, etc.) functioning?
- Did you link the right calendar? Check your [settings here](/profile?tab=calendar)
- Is your account syncing properly across devices?
- Are there any pending updates or maintenance notifications?
- When did you last perform system maintenance tasks?

**Step 3: Apply Systematic Solutions**

- Start with simplest solution first
- Test one change at a time
- Document what works for future reference
- Escalate to support if basic solutions don't work

## Project-Related Issues

### Issue: "My project isn't generating intelligent context"

**Symptoms**:

- Generic or minimal context fields
- AI suggestions seem irrelevant
- Context doesn't reflect project complexity

**Common Causes**:

- You didnt link the to the right project.

- Events appearing in wrong time zone
- Scheduling conflicts with existing appointments

**Solutions**:

**Settings Adjustment**:

1. **Update work hours**: Set correct start/end times for your work schedule
2. **Configure time zone**: Ensure primary time zone matches your location
3. **Set scheduling preferences**: Adjust AI scheduling preferences for your patterns

**Advanced Configuration**:

1. **Calendar priority rules**: Set which calendars take precedence for conflict detection
2. **Buffer time settings**: Adjust automatic buffer time between tasks
3. **Energy preference mapping**: Configure when different task types should be scheduled

## Brain Dump and AI Processing Issues

### Issue: "Brain dump parsing isn't creating relevant projects"

**Symptoms**:

- AI creates too many small projects instead of logical groupings
- Important themes not recognized as projects
- Irrelevant or duplicate projects generated

**Solutions**:

**Input Optimization**:

1. **Provide more context**: Include background, goals, and relationships between ideas
2. **Use clear project indicators**: Explicitly mention deliverables, timelines, and outcomes
3. **Structure your brain dump**: Group related thoughts together in your input

**Processing Refinement**:

1. **Manual project creation**: Create projects manually if AI parsing isn't effective
2. **Merge generated projects**: Combine overly granular AI-created projects
3. **Provide parsing feedback**: Mark which AI decisions were helpful vs. not helpful

### Issue: "AI suggestions don't match my working style"

**Symptoms**:

- Recommended priorities don't align with your preferences
