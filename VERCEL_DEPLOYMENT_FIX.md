# URGENT: Vercel Deployment Fix

## The Issue
Your build completes but Vercel shows "Build Completed in /vercel/output" and then hangs. This means the build files are being created but Vercel can't find them.

## IMMEDIATE FIX - Do This Now in Vercel Dashboard:

### Go to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → General → Build & Development Settings

**DISABLE ALL OVERRIDES and use these exact settings:**

1. **Framework Preset**: Other (not SvelteKit)

2. **Build Command** (if override enabled):
   ```
   cd apps/web && pnpm build
   ```

3. **Output Directory** (CRITICAL - if override enabled):
   ```
   apps/web/.vercel/output
   ```

4. **Install Command** (if override enabled):
   ```
   pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   ```

## Alternative Fix - Try This If Above Doesn't Work:

### In Vercel Dashboard Settings:

1. **Root Directory**: `apps/web` (change from ./ to apps/web)
2. **Framework Preset**: SvelteKit
3. **Build Command**: `pnpm build` (simple, no cd needed since root is apps/web)
4. **Output Directory**: `.vercel/output` (relative to apps/web)
5. **Install Command**: `cd .. && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`

## Why This Is Happening:

The Vercel build environment is having trouble with the monorepo structure. The build succeeds but the output path resolution is failing.

## Quick Test:

After changing settings:
1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Click on latest deployment
3. Click "..." → Redeploy
4. Watch the logs carefully

If it still hangs, try clearing the build cache:
- Settings → Advanced → Clear Build Cache → Clear Cache

## Nuclear Option (Last Resort):

If nothing works, create a new Vercel project:
1. Delete current project
2. Import repository again
3. When importing:
   - Set Root Directory to `apps/web`
   - Let Vercel auto-detect framework (SvelteKit)
   - Don't override any settings initially

## Expected Success Log:
You should see something like:
```
Build Completed in /vercel/output [2m]
Uploading build outputs...
Done with "apps/web"
```

If you only see "Build Completed" without "Uploading build outputs", the path is wrong.
