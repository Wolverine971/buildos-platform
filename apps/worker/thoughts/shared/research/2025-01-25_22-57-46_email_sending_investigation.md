# Research: Email Sending from Daily Brief

**Date**: 2025-01-25T22:57:46+0000
**Researcher**: Claude
**Git Commit**: 74e70eb30ed46bd4b3442cc270b1b5a438b2501e
**Branch**: main
**Repository**: daily-brief-worker

## Research Question

I am not sure if the emails are getting sent from the daily brief, please check and see what is happening

## Summary

The daily brief worker **has a fully implemented email system** that automatically sends HTML emails when briefs are generated. The system uses **Gmail SMTP via Nodemailer** and is integrated directly into the brief generation workflow. However, **emails will only be sent if Gmail credentials are configured** in the environment variables. Without proper configuration, the system operates in "simulation mode" where emails are logged but not actually sent.

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Email System is Fully Implemented

The codebase has a complete, production-ready email system with:

- Gmail SMTP integration using Nodemailer
- HTML email templates with professional styling
- Email tracking and analytics
- User opt-in preferences
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration Required

For emails to actually be sent, you need:

1. **Gmail credentials configured** in environment variables
2. **User opt-in** enabled in the database
3. **Valid user email address** in the profile

## Detailed Findings

### Email Service Implementation

- **Primary Service**: `/src/lib/services/email-service.ts` - Core email orchestration
- **Gmail Transporter**: `/src/lib/services/gmail-transporter.ts` - Gmail SMTP configuration
- **Daily Brief Sender**: `/src/lib/services/email-sender.ts` - Formats and sends brief emails
- **Dependencies**: `nodemailer@^7.0.6` for SMTP communication

### Email Integration in Worker Flow

The email dispatch happens automatically after successful brief generation:

- Location: `/src/workers/brief/briefWorker.ts:60-76`
- Process: After brief is created ‚Üí Check user opt-in ‚Üí Send email ‚Üí Log result
- **Non-blocking**: Email failures don't fail the brief generation job
- Success message: `üìß Email notification sent for brief {id}`
- Failure handling: Errors are logged but job continues

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Gmail Authentication (REQUIRED)
GMAIL_USER=your-gmail-account@gmail.com      # Your Gmail account
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx      # 16-character app password

# Optional Sender Configuration
GMAIL_ALIAS=noreply@build-os.com            # Custom sender address (must be verified in Gmail)
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=BuildOS                     # Display name for sender
```

### Gmail App Password Setup

1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
2. Go to Google Account Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App passwords
3. Generate new app password for "Mail"
4. Use the 16-character password as `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`

### Database Configuration

- **User Preferences**: `user_brief_preferences.email_daily_brief` must be `true`
- **User Email**: Valid email address in `profiles` table
- **Tracking Tables**: `emails`, `email_recipients`, `email_logs`, `email_tracking_events`

## Architecture Insights

### Design Decisions

1. **Integrated Architecture**: Email is part of the worker flow, not a separate service
2. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues working even if email fails
3. **Development Mode**: Without Gmail config, emails are simulated and logged
4. **User Control**: Respects user opt-in preferences from database
5. **Comprehensive Tracking**: All email attempts logged with detailed metadata

### Email Flow

1. Scheduler/API triggers brief generation job
2. Worker processes brief and generates content
3. System checks if user has opted in for emails
4. Email service formats brief as HTML with tracking
5. Gmail SMTP sends the email
6. All activity logged to database
7. Real-time notification sent to UI

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Why Emails Might Not Be Sending

1. **Missing Gmail Configuration**
   - Check: `echo $GMAIL_USER` and `echo $GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`
   - Fix: Add credentials to `.env` file

2. **User Hasn't Opted In**
   - Check: `user_brief_preferences.email_daily_brief` column
   - Fix: Set to `true` for the user

3. **Invalid Gmail App Password**
   - Symptoms: Authentication errors in logs
   - Fix: Generate new app password from Google Account settings

4. **Gmail Sending Limits**
   - Limit: 500 emails/day for regular accounts
   - Fix: Use Google Workspace account or alternative service

5. **Development Mode**
   - Symptom: Logs show "Email (simulated)"
   - Fix: Configure Gmail credentials

### Testing Email Configuration

```bash
# Test configuration and send test email
pnpm tsx tests/test-email.ts your-email@example.com
```

### Checking Email Logs

Monitor email activity in these locations:

- Console logs: Look for `üìß` emoji prefix
- Database: Query `email_logs` table for attempt history
- Tracking: Check `email_tracking_events` for opens/clicks

- Gmail alias setup instructions in transporter code

## Open Questions

1. Are the Gmail credentials currently configured in production?
2. Have users opted in for email notifications?
3. Are there any rate limiting concerns with current email volume?
4. Should we implement retry logic for failed emails?

## Recommendation

To ensure emails are being sent:

1. Verify Gmail credentials are set in environment variables
2. Check user email preferences in database
3. Monitor `email_logs` table for sending attempts
4. Run test email script to verify configuration
5. Review console logs for email status messages
