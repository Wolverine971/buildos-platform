## Quick Answer to Your Question

> "I see that a brief is getting generated but I dont know if the email is getting sent. Idk if it is using the right variables."

**Answer:** The email system uses a **two-phase architecture**:

1. **Phase 1 (Working):** Generate brief ‚Üí Creates email record in database
2. **Phase 2 (Check Required):** Email worker sends the actual email

**To verify if emails are actually being sent:**

```sql
-- 1. Check if email records are created
SELECT id, status, sent_at, subject
FROM emails
WHERE created_by = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 2. Check if email jobs are processed
SELECT queue_job_id, job_type, status, completed_at
FROM queue_jobs
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
  AND job_type = 'generate_brief_email'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 3. Check actual email delivery attempts
SELECT to_email, status, sent_at, error_message
FROM email_logs
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
ORDER BY sent_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected Results:**

- `emails.status` should be `'sent'` (not `'pending'`)
- `queue_jobs.status` should be `'completed'` (not `'pending'`)
- `email_logs` should have entries with `status='sent'` (or `'simulated'` if no SMTP configured)

## Critical Findings

### ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Scheduler logic is correct** - All timezone calculations work properly
2. **Variable usage is correct** - All data flows properly through the system
3. **Database schema is valid** - All required fields exist
4. **Type safety is maintained** - No TypeScript errors

### üî¥ Critical Issues Found (5 bugs)

1. **Database Enum Migration** - Verify `generate_brief_email` exists in production
2. **Missing Engagement Metadata** - Re-engagement info not passed to email worker
3. **No Email Config Validation** - Silent failure if neither webhook nor SMTP configured
4. **Email Status Inconsistency** - Cancelled emails don't update recipient status
5. **Timezone Fallback Silent** - Users with invalid timezones get wrong times

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Issues (3 issues)

1. **Ambiguous transport selection** - Hard to tell which email method is used
2. **Missing env var docs** - Email configuration not clearly documented
3. **No startup validation** - Worker doesn't verify email transport at startup

## Most Likely Reason Emails Aren't Sending

Based on the code analysis, the most likely causes are:

### 1. Email Transport Not Configured (80% likely)

Check these environment variables:

```bash
# Railway worker service
echo $USE_WEBHOOK_EMAIL         # Should be "true" or left unset
echo $BUILDOS_WEBHOOK_URL       # Should be https://build-os.com/webhooks/...
echo $PRIVATE_BUILDOS_WEBHOOK_SECRET  # Should be set

# OR for direct SMTP
echo $GMAIL_USER                # Should be set
echo $GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD        # Should be set
```

**If none are set:** Emails are being "simulated" (logged but not sent).

### 2. Database Enum Not Migrated (15% likely)

The worker tries to queue `generate_brief_email` jobs, but if the enum doesn't exist:

```sql
-- Run this to check:
SELECT enumlabel
FROM pg_enum
WHERE enumtypid = 'queue_type'::regtype
  AND enumlabel = 'generate_brief_email';

-- Should return 1 row. If empty, run migrations:
-- 1. apps/web/supabase/migrations/20250930_add_email_brief_job_type_part1.sql
-- 2. apps/web/supabase/migrations/20250930_add_email_brief_job_type_part2.sql
```

### 3. User Preferences Not Enabled (5% likely)

```sql
-- Check if user opted in:
SELECT
  email_daily_brief,  -- Should be TRUE
  is_active           -- Should be TRUE
FROM user_brief_preferences
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Fix Emails Now)

1. **Check environment variables** on Railway worker service
2. **Run database migrations** if enum is missing
3. **Check worker logs** for email processing messages
4. **Query database** using the SQL above to see where emails are getting stuck

### Short-term (Fix Bugs)

1. **Add startup validation** - Fail fast if email not configured
2. **Fix Bug #2** - Pass engagement metadata to email worker
3. **Fix Bug #5** - Update recipient status on cancellation
4. **Add logging** - More verbose email transport selection

### Long-term (Prevent Issues)

1. **Document email configuration** in README
2. **Add monitoring** - Alert if emails aren't being sent
3. **Add admin dashboard** - Show email delivery stats
4. **Make schema stricter** - Non-nullable fields with defaults

## Next Steps

1. **Run the diagnostic queries** in SCHEDULER_ANALYSIS_AND_BUGS.md
2. **Check worker logs** for email processing messages
3. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
4. **Check database migrations** are applied

If you need help debugging a specific user, provide their `user_id` and I can help trace through the exact flow.
