## 🎬 Recommended Timeline

### Option 1: Aggressive (2 weeks, 1 developer)

```
Week 1: Phase 1 critical fixes (10-14 hrs)
Week 2: Phase 2-3 combined (33-46 hrs)
Result: 92 → 95/100 design health in 2 weeks
```

### Option 2: Sustainable (4-6 weeks, 1 developer part-time)

```
Week 1-2: Phase 1 critical fixes (10-14 hrs)
Week 2-3: Phase 2 color system (15-22 hrs)
Week 4-5: Phase 3 consistency (18-24 hrs)
Week 6: Phase 4 optional (20-30 hrs)
Result: 92 → 96/100 design health in 6 weeks
```

### Option 3: Distributed (8-12 weeks, integrated with features)

```
1 component per week refactored alongside feature work
Result: 92 → 95/100 design health in 3-4 months
```

**Recommendation**: Option 2 (Sustainable) for best balance

## 💡 Key Principles

### 1. Design Health Score

- Tracks consistency, accessibility, maintainability
- Current: 92/100 (Good)
- Target: 96/100 (Excellent)
- Formula: Based on adherence to design patterns

### 2. Incremental Improvement

- Don't try to fix everything at once
- Phases are sequential, not parallel
- Each phase builds on previous
- Low risk of regression

### 3. User-Centric

- WCAG AA compliance = accessibility for all users
- Dark mode = better user experience
- Consistent patterns = easier to learn/use
- Small details = big impact

### 4. Maintainability

- Reduces technical debt
- Makes future changes easier
- Improves code reusability
- Attracts better developers
