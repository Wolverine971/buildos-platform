# Projects **List** Page — Hyperplexed Design Audit

> Second live application of the [Hyperplexed Design Playbook](./HYPERPLEXED_DESIGN_PLAYBOOK.md).
> Surface: **Projects index** — `apps/web/src/routes/projects/+page.svelte` and its list/filter child
> components. (Companion to [`PROJECT_PAGE_AUDIT_2026-06-26.md`](./PROJECT_PAGE_AUDIT_2026-06-26.md),
> which covered the project **detail** page.)
> Method: audited Hyperplexed-style — **region by region, top to bottom** — grading rendered markup
> against the §1/§2 rubric. Captured 2026-06-26.
>
> **Scope caveat:** static markup audit (the DOM each component emits + its Tailwind/Inkprint classes),
> not a screenshot audit. High confidence on structure (alignment, padding symmetry, overflow, radius,
> motion gating, keyboard a11y, icon-set uniformity). Color/contrast calls in dark mode want a live pass.
>
> **Cross-reference:** the detail-page audit already shipped a shared helper
> `lib/components/project/v2/board-a11y.ts` (`handleRovingTabKeydown` + reduced-motion-aware
> `slideMotion`) and locked a two-radius rule. **This page predates those conventions and adopts none of
> them** — most fixes below are "apply the rule you already wrote, here too."

## The headline: strong list rows, weak controls

The **content layer is genuinely good**. `ProjectStateRow` is alignment-safe the way Hyperplexed wants:
`min-w-0` wrappers, `truncate` on title/description/next-step/counts, a `shrink-0` right cluster, and an
arrow that reveals via **opacity** on hover/focus so it never shifts layout (`ProjectStateRow:88-108,129-141`).
Rows are real `<a href>` links (keyboard-operable) and carry a `:focus-visible` affordance. That's the
hard part, and it's done.

The defects cluster almost entirely in the **control chrome above the list** — the toggles, chips, and
filter buttons. And they're the _same five systemic patterns the detail-page audit already named_, just
on a surface that never received the fix. So this is a **"propagate the conventions" audit**, not a new
diagnosis. The one genuinely new finding is **icon-set inconsistency** (§N1).

---

## Part 1 — Systemic patterns (same rules as the detail audit; apply them here)

### S2. ⛔ "Selected" is signaled **four different ways** on one screen _(highest leverage here)_

**Rubric:** Readability (active vs inactive must be obvious) + Color (one restrained accent).

This page stacks four independent "active control" treatments within ~600px of vertical space:

| Control                         | Active treatment                                        | Ref                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Header Graph/Overview toggle    | `bg-accent text-accent-foreground shadow-ink`           | `+page.svelte:597-599`    |
| Status count strip              | `bg-accent/15 text-accent font-semibold`                | `+page.svelte:753`        |
| Ownership segmented (All/Mine/Shared) | `bg-card text-foreground shadow-ink` (no accent)  | `+page.svelte:844`        |
| State/Context/Scale/Stage chips | `border-accent bg-accent text-accent-foreground shadow-ink` | `FilterGroup.svelte:40` |

Four "you-selected-this" languages: solid-accent, accent-tint, neutral-card, and bordered-accent. The
detail audit's S2 fix was "pick **one** active treatment and apply it identically to every tab/pill."
That same convention should govern this page. Recommend: solid-accent fill for the two true _toggles_
(header view, ownership), accent-tint for the multi-select _filter chips + count strip_ — i.e. two
deliberate tiers (mode vs filter), not four accidental ones.

### S3. `focus-visible` rings are missing on **every control except the list rows**

**Rubric:** Motion & A11y — _"operate this entire flow via my keyboard."_

`ProjectStateRow` models the right pattern (`:focus-visible` inset accent shadow). Nothing else copies it.
All of these carry only `pressable` (a press-scale token, **not** a focus token):

- Header view-toggle buttons (`+page.svelte:596,608`)
- Status count-strip buttons (`+page.svelte:752`)
- Filters-panel toggle (`+page.svelte:772`)
- Ownership segmented buttons (`+page.svelte:842`)
- FilterGroup chips (`FilterGroup.svelte:38`)
- Clear-all-filters button (`+page.svelte:909`)
- CollapsibleStateSection header toggle (`CollapsibleStateSection.svelte:63`)

**Note (accuracy):** unlike the detail page, there is **no roving-tabindex-without-arrows bug** here — the
count strip and segmented controls are independent `<button>`s, each Tab-reachable. So the keyboard gap is
narrower: it's purely the **missing focus ring**, not unreachable elements. Fix is one `focus-visible:ring-2
focus-visible:ring-ring` utility swept across the seven controls above. (Optional polish: give the two
segmented controls real `role="tablist"`/`radiogroup` + arrow keys via the existing
`handleRovingTabKeydown` helper — but that's an enhancement, not a blocker.)

### S4. Corner-radius drifts below the locked two-radius rule

**Rubric:** Geometry — consistent corner-radius language. (Detail audit locked: `rounded-lg`
cards/containers/dropdowns, `rounded-md` inner controls/chips/skeleton placeholders.)

Offenders that use **bare `rounded`** where the rule says `rounded-md`:

- Status count-strip buttons — `rounded` (`+page.svelte:752`)
- Ownership segmented inner buttons — `rounded` (`+page.svelte:842`)
- Inline fallback-skeleton placeholders — `rounded` (`+page.svelte:630-632`)

Plus one container/inner inversion: the **stats-grid skeleton bars** use bare `rounded` (`:679,696,713,730`)
while `ProjectListSkeleton` correctly uses `rounded-md` (`ProjectListSkeleton:18-22`) — two skeleton
languages on one page (see §S-NEW below).

### S5. `prefers-reduced-motion` is **never** gated on this page

**Rubric:** Motion & A11y — respect reduced-motion.

The detail page gates its hydration fades on `prefersReducedMotion`; **this page imports no such guard at
all.** Everything animates unconditionally:

- `animate-spin` title loader (`+page.svelte:580`)
- `animate-pulse` on all stats skeletons + inline fallback skeleton (`:679,696,713,730,629`)
- `transition-transform` chevrons — filters panel (`:791`) and CollapsibleStateSection (`:87`)
- `transition-all duration-200` filter-panel grid collapse (`:799`) and header toggle (`:596,608`)

**Fix:** `motion-reduce:animate-none` on the spinner + pulses; `motion-reduce:transition-none` on the
chevrons and the collapse grid. (No `transition:slide` here, so `slideMotion()` isn't needed — the CSS
`motion-reduce:` variants cover it.)

---

## Part 1b — New systemic finding unique to this page

### N1. ⛔ Mixed icon sets — hand-rolled inline SVGs amid an all-lucide page

**Rubric:** Color & Icons — _"one uniform icon set... it's crazy how much of a difference better icons
can make."_

The page imports lucide icons (`LoaderCircle, Plus, SlidersHorizontal, ChevronDown`) and uses lucide
throughout the rows/chips — then **hand-rolls two raw `<svg>` paths**:

- The search-field magnifier (`+page.svelte:813-826`) — should be lucide `Search`.
- The empty-state folder glyph (`+page.svelte:932-945`) — should be lucide `Folder`/`FolderOpen`.

These render at a different stroke weight/optical style than the lucide set sitting inches away, and they
bypass the `src/lib/icons/lucide.ts` alias the rest of the app routes through. Swap both to lucide for a
uniform stroke language. (Cheap, high "polish" signal — exactly his "better icons" point.)

---

## Part 2 — Per-surface findings

Severity: **High** = breaks readability/behavior-legibility or blocks keyboard use · **Med** = polish
gap · **Low** = nitpick. Items folded into S2–S5 / N1 are tagged and not repeated in full.

### Surface 1 — Header + view toggle (admin)

| Sev | Region          | Defect                                                                                  | Fix                              |
| --- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Med | View toggle     | No `focus-visible` ring (→S3); active uses solid-accent — one of four active styles (→S2) | Ring + unify active treatment    |
| Low | Title spinner   | `animate-spin` ungated (→S5)                                                             | `motion-reduce:animate-none`     |
| Low | Toggle a11y     | `<nav>` + `aria-pressed` buttons; functions as a tablist but isn't one                   | Optional `role="tablist"` + arrows |

**Strengths:** micro-label pattern + `text-accent` restraint; title `line-clamp` not needed (single word);
toggle container is correct `wt-card` (rounded-lg) wrapping `rounded-md` inner buttons — radius rule
already satisfied _here_.

### Surface 2 — New-Project action row

| Sev | Region        | Defect                                                                                                          | Fix                                        |
| --- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Med | Button style  | Six one-off color overrides on `<Button variant="outline">` (`border-accent/30 bg-card text-accent…` `:662`) re-implement a variant inline | Promote to a real Button variant / token   |
| Low | Placement     | Primary creation action is a small outline button parked top-right — hardest mobile thumb reach, low prominence | Consider sticky/bottom create on mobile    |

**Strengths:** `whitespace-nowrap` so the label never wraps; lucide `Plus` icon (uniform).

### Surface 3 — Stats grid

| Sev | Region          | Defect                                                                                                             | Fix                                       |
| --- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Low | Texture variety | Four different textures across four sibling cards (`tx-frame/grain/thread/pulse` `:671,688,705,722`) read as decorative variety, not meaning | Use one texture; reserve variation for the accented ACTIVE card |
| Low | Skeleton bars   | Bare `rounded` + ungated `animate-pulse` (→S4, S5)                                                                  | `rounded-md` + `motion-reduce:`           |

**Strengths:** disciplined hierarchy — only the ACTIVE card carries accent (`border-accent/30 bg-accent/5`
+ accent number), so the eye lands on the one meaningful stat; micro-label sizing consistent across all four;
zero-layout-shift skeletons sized to the real numbers.

### Surface 4 — Status count strip

| Sev | Region        | Defect                                                                                                       | Fix                                  |
| --- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Med | Duplicate path | Filtering by state lives **twice** for admins — this strip (single-select quick filter) _and_ the "State" FilterGroup (multi-select) inside the panel | Merge: make the strip the canonical state filter, or drop "State" from the panel |
| Med | Active style  | `bg-accent/15 text-accent` — third of four active treatments (→S2)                                            | Unify                                |
| Low | Geometry/focus | Bare `rounded` (→S4); no `focus-visible` (→S3)                                                                | `rounded-md` + ring                  |

**Strengths:** counts ignore the state filter so users see how much work sits elsewhere and can swap —
genuinely good IA; `disabled` on zero-count states with muted styling; `aria-pressed` wired.

### Surface 5 — Search & Filters panel

| Sev | Region            | Defect                                                                                                  | Fix                                  |
| --- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Med | Search icon       | Hand-rolled inline `<svg>` magnifier amid all-lucide page (→N1)                                          | lucide `Search`                      |
| Med | Ownership segmented | `bg-card` active (no accent) = 2nd-of-4 active styles (→S2); inner `rounded` (→S4); no focus ring (→S3) | Unify active + `rounded-md` + ring   |
| Med | Filter chips      | 4th active style (→S2); no focus ring (→S3)                                                              | Unify + ring                         |
| Low | Search field      | `rounded-lg` input vs `rounded-md` inner-control rule; no clear-(✕) button unlike the detail combobox    | Confirm radius intent; add clear     |
| Low | Panel motion      | Collapse `transition-all` + chevron `transition-transform` ungated (→S5)                                 | `motion-reduce:transition-none`      |

**Strengths:** the whole filter set is correctly consolidated behind **one expandable "Search & Filters"
button with a selected-count badge** — this is _exactly_ Hyperplexed's "collapse into one Filters button
that expands, with selected-state chips" pattern, done right (`:769-795`). `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls`
wired; `FilterGroup` cleanly de-duplicates four filter blocks.

### Surface 6 — Project rows + recency + secondary sections

| Sev | Region              | Defect                                                                                                          | Fix                                       |
| --- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Low | Title/chip wrap     | Title+chip+shared-badge container is `flex-wrap` (`ProjectStateRow:49`) — on narrow widths the chip drops below the title, raising row height | Keep title on its own line; chips below by design, or `flex-nowrap` + truncate |
| Low | Hover-only arrow    | Arrow is `opacity:0` until hover/focus — never appears on touch (`ProjectStateRow:129-141`)                     | Fine (row is the link); optional always-on at low opacity on mobile |
| Low | Section toggle      | CollapsibleStateSection header lacks `focus-visible` (→S3); chevron ungated (→S5)                               | Ring + `motion-reduce:`                   |
| Low | Code dup            | `.project-recency-separator` style block + recency-render path duplicated in both `+page.svelte:1164` and `CollapsibleStateSection:96-113,128`; the primary tier renders inline, so the component's recency path is effectively dead | Consolidate into one component path       |

**Strengths:** this is the well-built surface — overflow handled everywhere (`truncate` ×4 fields,
`min-w-0`, `shrink-0` right cluster), real `<a>` links, opacity-reveal arrow (no layout shift),
size-based hierarchy (`text-xl` primary / `text-lg` secondary), contained `ProjectIcon`, and a
`:focus-visible` affordance the rest of the page should copy.

### Surface 7 — Empty states + skeletons

| Sev  | Region              | Defect                                                                                                                                  | Fix                                          |
| ---- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| High | Skeleton mismatch   | Two different skeleton shapes for the same content: the **inline fallback** (when `projectCount` is 0/unknown) is a **3-col grid of cards** (`:627-635`), but the real list is a **vertical dossier list** and `ProjectListSkeleton` matches it. The fallback guarantees a layout-shape jump — contradicting the file's own "Zero layout shift" header comment | Make the fallback render `ProjectListSkeleton` (or a 3-row vertical placeholder) |
| Med  | Empty-state icon    | Hand-rolled folder `<svg>` (→N1)                                                                                                        | lucide `Folder`                              |
| Low  | Fallback skeleton   | Bare `rounded` + ungated `animate-pulse` (→S4,S5)                                                                                       | `rounded-md` + `motion-reduce:`              |

**Strengths:** `ProjectListSkeleton` is shape-accurate (`rounded-md`, dossier rows); "No projects yet" is a
proper unglamorous state with icon + copy + primary CTA; the empty copy correctly branches on
"no projects at all" vs "filters hide everything."

### Surface 8 — Graph view (admin)

Low priority (admin-gated). Loading/error/empty states are all present and tailored — good unglamorous-state
coverage. Only carryover: the controls/details panels and graph card inherit S3/S5 gaps if their child
components do; out of scope for this list-page pass.

---

## Part 3 — Recommended fix sequence (one convention at a time)

Each clears multiple Part-2 rows. Most are "import the rule the detail audit already wrote."

1. **S2 — collapse four active styles into two tiers** (mode toggles vs filters). Highest taste payoff;
   touches header toggle, count strip, ownership segmented, FilterGroup.
2. **S3 — `focus-visible` ring sweep** across the seven controls (copy `ProjectStateRow`'s pattern). One
   utility, applied everywhere.
3. **N1 — swap the two inline SVGs to lucide** (`Search`, `Folder`). Cheap, visible uniformity win.
4. **Surface 7 High — unify the loading skeleton** so the fallback matches the vertical list (kills the
   layout-shape jump the file claims it prevents).
5. **S4 — sweep bare `rounded` → `rounded-md`** on count strip, ownership buttons, both skeleton sets.
6. **S5 — `motion-reduce:` variants** on the spinner, pulses, chevrons, and collapse grid (this page gates
   nothing today).
7. **Cleanups:** dedupe the State filter (count strip vs FilterGroup), promote the New-Project button's
   inline color overrides to a variant, consolidate the duplicated recency-separator path.

---

## Part 4 — How this stacks with the detail-page audit

The two audits **rhyme**, which validates the rubric as a repeatable instrument: S2 (active-state
inconsistency), S3 (focus rings), S4 (radius), and S5 (reduced-motion) recur on both surfaces. That's the
Hyperplexed thesis in practice — _"the same small problem wearing different costumes."_ The fixes shipped
for the detail page (the `board-a11y.ts` helper, the two-radius rule, the one-active-treatment rule) are
**conventions the whole app should inherit**, and this page is the next place to apply them.

Two things are genuinely _better_ here than on the detail page: the filter set is already consolidated into
the canonical "one Filters button + count badge + chips" pattern, and the list rows are overflow-/keyboard-
clean out of the box. Two things are _new_: the **icon-set inconsistency** (N1) and the **skeleton-shape
mismatch** (Surface 7 High) — neither appeared on the detail page.

**Next step:** the live dark-mode screenshot pass — confirm the four-active-style collision actually reads
as confusing in pixels (it should), and the stats-grid texture variety call.
