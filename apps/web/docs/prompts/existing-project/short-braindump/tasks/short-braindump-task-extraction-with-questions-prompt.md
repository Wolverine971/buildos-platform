## Primary Job: Extract Tasks
1. **IDENTIFY** all actionable items EXPLICITLY mentioned in the braindump
2. **CREATE** tasks ONLY for items directly stated - DO NOT add preparatory or follow-up tasks
3. **ANALYZE** if displayed questions were answered
4. **DETERMINE** if project context needs updating based on decision matrix

**CRITICAL RULES**:
- Extract ONLY tasks that are explicitly mentioned
- DO NOT proactively create setup, preparatory, or follow-up tasks
- DO NOT fill gaps or add "missing" tasks
- ONLY exception: If user explicitly says "create setup tasks" or "add follow-up tasks"
- Consider existing tasks to avoid duplicates and understand project context

**Context Update Criteria** (Update context when):
1. Strategic insights or learnings emerge
2. Scope or boundaries change
3. New stakeholders or dependencies identified
4. Approach or methodology evolves
5. Risks or assumptions change
6. External factors shift
7. Major decisions made
8. **Project structure needs evolution** (add new sections, reorganize existing ones to better communicate the project's story)

**Don't Update Context For**:
- Simple task completions
- Minor status changes
- Day-to-day progress
- Temporary blockers

**Remember**: Context structure should evolve with the project. Don't be constrained by the initial framework - adapt it as the project's needs become clearer.

Otherwise, treat it as task-level updates only.

## Task Model:
tasks: {
  title: string (required, max 255),
  project_id: "b859746f-e3da-4e5a-9f06-718746d7ae8c" (required),
  description: string,
  details: string (specifics mentioned in braindump),
  status: "backlog"|"in_progress"|"done"|"blocked",
  priority: "low"|"medium"|"high",
  task_type: "one_off"|"recurring",
  duration_minutes?: number,
  start_date?: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS" (timestamptz - parse dates AND times, intelligently order tasks throughout the day e.g. "2024-03-15T09:00:00" for 9am, "2024-03-15T14:30:00" for 2:30pm, REQUIRED if task_type is "recurring"),
  recurrence_pattern?: "daily"|"weekdays"|"weekly"|"biweekly"|"monthly"|"quarterly"|"yearly" (REQUIRED if task_type is "recurring"),
  recurrence_ends?: "YYYY-MM-DD" (date only - parse from braindump or defaults to project end date if not specified),
  dependencies?: string[],
  parent_task_id?: string
}

## Date Parsing:
- "next week" → start_date: next Monday (calculate actual date)
   - "30 days" → end_date: 30 days from start_date (calculate actual date)
   - "3 months" → end_date: 3 months from start_date (calculate actual date)
   - "by end of month" → end_date: last day of current month
   - "in 2 weeks" → start_date: 2 weeks from today
   - "next Monday" → specific date of next Monday
   - "starting tomorrow" → start_date: tomorrow's date
   - "due Friday" → end_date: this Friday's date
   - "by Christmas" → end_date: 2025-12-25
   - "Q1" → end_date: March 31st of current year
   - "Q2" → end_date: June 30th of current year
   - Always calculate actual YYYY-MM-DD dates, NEVER use relative terms
   - If no timeline mentioned, use start_date: today, end_date: null
   - Current date context: Today is 2025-10-02

**RECURRING TASK RULES**:
- If a task mentions recurring patterns (daily, weekly, etc.), set task_type to "recurring"
- Recurring tasks MUST have a start_date (use today's date if not specified)
- Recurring tasks MUST have a recurrence_pattern matching the frequency mentioned
- If recurrence_ends is not mentioned, leave it null (will inherit from project end date)
- Examples:
  • "Review code every Friday" → task_type: "recurring", recurrence_pattern: "weekly", start_date: next Friday
  • "Daily standup" → task_type: "recurring", recurrence_pattern: "daily", start_date: tomorrow
  • "Monthly report" → task_type: "recurring", recurrence_pattern: "monthly", start_date: first of next month

## Questions to Analyze:
- Question 9c4d2d89-6af7-4f3b-8fbd-115a6834176c: "What feedback have we received from high school students regarding our current marketing efforts?"
- Question 56f8432f-f476-4dc7-8ab5-89ddfa659c99: "What channels are most effective for reaching high school students?"
- Question 2ec79e59-7da8-44ea-b988-4b3bdb96dbfd: "What specific aspects of the current marketing strategy need to be changed to appeal to high school students?"

Determine if each question was addressed in the braindump.
Include in your response:
"questionAnalysis": {
  "[questionId]": {
    "wasAnswered": boolean,
    "answerContent": "extracted answer if addressed, null otherwise"
  }
}

## Generate Project Questions:
Generate 3-5 NEW questions that:
- Help the user think about the next steps based off of the project's current state and the new info coming from the braindump
- Help clarify vague aspects or ambiguous requirements
- Identify critical decisions that need to be made
- Break down complex problems into manageable steps
- Surface potential blockers, risks, or resource needs
- Move the project forward with concrete next steps

Questions should:
- Be specific and actionable and reference something specific in the project
- Spark creative thinking for productive future braindumps

Question categories:
- **clarification**: Define vague concepts
- **decision**: Force choices on open items
- **planning**: Break down large tasks
- **risk**: Identify potential obstacles
- **resource**: Clarify needs and constraints

Generate 3-5 NEW questions that help move the project forward based on the current state and new information from this braindump.
