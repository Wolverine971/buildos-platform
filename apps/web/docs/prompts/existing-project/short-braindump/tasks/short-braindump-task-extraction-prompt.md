## Current Project Data:
**Project: Development of Fantasy Novel 'The Last Ember'**
**ID:** 08439479-c5e4-40cb-bd04-f94cb97702a6
**Status:** active | **Description:** Creating a fantasy novel about magical blacksmithing in a threatened kingdom.
**Timeline:** 2025-09-30 â†’ Not set
**Tags:** updated, feedback, revision
**Executive Summary:**
The project is currently focused on completing the first draft of 'The Last Ember' by March 31st, with plans for both traditional and self-publishing routes. Recent feedback from the critique group has identified major revisions needed for the first three chapters to enhance pacing, character voice, and emotional depth.

**Context:**
##### Feedback from Critique Group

###### Chapter 1 Issues
- Opening is too slow - start with action not description
- Elena needs stronger voice from page 1
- Cut the 3 pages of world history - weave it in later

###### Chapter 2 Improvements Needed
- Master Thorne's dialogue too modern - needs more archaic feel
- Add scene showing Elena's daily forge work before the discovery
- The dragon forge discovery happens too easily - add obstacles

###### Chapter 3 Restructure
- Move the prophecy reveal to chapter 5
- Focus on Elena's emotional journey
- Add more conflict with Kai about her destiny

###### Writing Style Notes
- Too many adverbs - search and destroy
- Vary sentence structure more
- Stop using 'suddenly' as a crutch
- Better sensory details in action scenes

###### Publication Options

###### Traditional Publishing Route
- Need to write query letter
- Create 1-page synopsis
- Research fantasy literary agents (looking at agents who rep Brandon Sanderson, Robin Hobb)
- Prepare first 3 chapters as sample

###### Self-Publishing Considerations
- Budget $3000 for professional editing
- Find cover artist specializing in fantasy
- Plan pre-launch marketing campaign
- Set up author website and newsletter

###### Timeline
- Finish first draft: March 31
- Self-edit: April
- Beta readers: May
- Professional edit: June-July
- Query agents or launch self-pub: August

###### Additional Goals
- Start building author platform on social media
- Write short stories in same universe for magazines
- Create series bible if this becomes Book 1

## Primary Job: Extract Tasks
1. **IDENTIFY** all actionable items EXPLICITLY mentioned in the braindump
2. **CREATE** tasks ONLY for items directly stated - DO NOT add preparatory or follow-up tasks
3. **ANALYZE** if displayed questions were answered
4. **DETERMINE** if project context needs updating based on decision matrix

**CRITICAL RULES**:
- Extract ONLY tasks that are explicitly mentioned
- DO NOT proactively create setup, preparatory, or follow-up tasks
- DO NOT fill gaps or add "missing" tasks
- ONLY exception: If user explicitly says "create setup tasks" or "add follow-up tasks"
- Consider existing tasks to avoid duplicates and understand project context

**Context Update Criteria** (Update context when):
1. Strategic insights or learnings emerge
2. Scope or boundaries change
3. New stakeholders or dependencies identified
4. Approach or methodology evolves
5. Risks or assumptions change
6. External factors shift
7. Major decisions made
8. **Project structure needs evolution** (add new sections, reorganize existing ones to better communicate the project's story)

**Don't Update Context For**:
- Simple task completions
- Minor status changes
- Day-to-day progress
- Temporary blockers

**Remember**: Context structure should evolve with the project. Don't be constrained by the initial framework - adapt it as the project's needs become clearer.

Otherwise, treat it as task-level updates only.

## Task Model:
tasks: {
  title: string (required, max 255),
  project_id: "08439479-c5e4-40cb-bd04-f94cb97702a6" (required),
  description: string,
  details: string (specifics mentioned in braindump),
  status: "backlog"|"in_progress"|"done"|"blocked",
  priority: "low"|"medium"|"high",
  task_type: "one_off"|"recurring",
  duration_minutes?: number,
  start_date?: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS" (timestamptz - parse dates AND times, intelligently order tasks throughout the day e.g. "2024-03-15T09:00:00" for 9am, "2024-03-15T14:30:00" for 2:30pm, REQUIRED if task_type is "recurring"),
  recurrence_pattern?: "daily"|"weekdays"|"weekly"|"biweekly"|"monthly"|"quarterly"|"yearly" (REQUIRED if task_type is "recurring"),
  recurrence_ends?: "YYYY-MM-DD" (date only - parse from braindump or defaults to project end date if not specified),
  dependencies?: string[],
  parent_task_id?: string
}

## Date Parsing:
- "next week" â†’ start_date: next Monday (calculate actual date)
   - "30 days" â†’ end_date: 30 days from start_date (calculate actual date)
   - "3 months" â†’ end_date: 3 months from start_date (calculate actual date)
   - "by end of month" â†’ end_date: last day of current month
   - "in 2 weeks" â†’ start_date: 2 weeks from today
   - "next Monday" â†’ specific date of next Monday
   - "starting tomorrow" â†’ start_date: tomorrow's date
   - "due Friday" â†’ end_date: this Friday's date
   - "by Christmas" â†’ end_date: 2025-12-25
   - "Q1" â†’ end_date: March 31st of current year
   - "Q2" â†’ end_date: June 30th of current year
   - Always calculate actual YYYY-MM-DD dates, NEVER use relative terms
   - If no timeline mentioned, use start_date: today, end_date: null
   - Current date context: Today is 2025-09-30

**RECURRING TASK RULES**:
- If a task mentions recurring patterns (daily, weekly, etc.), set task_type to "recurring"
- Recurring tasks MUST have a start_date (use today's date if not specified)
- Recurring tasks MUST have a recurrence_pattern matching the frequency mentioned
- If recurrence_ends is not mentioned, leave it null (will inherit from project end date)
- Examples:
  â€¢ "Review code every Friday" â†’ task_type: "recurring", recurrence_pattern: "weekly", start_date: next Friday
  â€¢ "Daily standup" â†’ task_type: "recurring", recurrence_pattern: "daily", start_date: tomorrow
  â€¢ "Monthly report" â†’ task_type: "recurring", recurrence_pattern: "monthly", start_date: first of next month

## Generate Project Questions:
Generate 3-5 NEW questions that:

Question categories:
- **clarification**: Define vague concepts
- **decision**: Force choices on open items
- **planning**: Break down large tasks
- **risk**: Identify potential obstacles
- **resource**: Clarify needs and constraints

Generate 3-5 NEW questions that help move the project forward based on the current state and new information from this braindump.
