Mode: TASK-FIRST EXTRACTION with optional context update for project c5340848-2264-4540-8789-beef44bcdf24

## Current Project Data:
**Project: AVI meetings teaching claude code**
**ID:** c5340848-2264-4540-8789-beef44bcdf24
**Status:** active | **Description:** Develop and implement an automated system for processing transcripts using Claude code agents, focusing on efficiency and accuracy.
**Timeline:** 2025-09-23 → 2025-10-01
**Tags:** automation, transcripts, Claude code
**Executive Summary:**
Automate transcript processing using Claude code agents to enhance efficiency and accuracy.

**Context:**
##### Situation & Environment
Currently, transcript processing is a manual and time-consuming task. The project aims to automate this process using Claude code agents to improve efficiency and reduce errors.

##### Purpose & Vision
The vision is to create a seamless, automated transcript processing system that integrates with existing workflows and enhances productivity.

##### Scope & Boundaries
The project includes developing the automation system, testing it with real transcripts, and deploying it for regular use.

##### Approach & Execution
The approach involves iterative development, continuous testing, and integration with existing tools.

##### Coordination & Control
Regular meetings with stakeholders to ensure alignment and address any issues.

##### Knowledge & Learning
Document lessons learned and best practices for future automation projects.

## Primary Job: Extract Tasks
1. **IDENTIFY** all actionable items EXPLICITLY mentioned in the braindump
2. **CREATE** tasks ONLY for items directly stated - DO NOT add preparatory or follow-up tasks
3. **ANALYZE** if displayed questions were answered
4. **DETERMINE** if project context needs updating based on decision matrix

**CRITICAL RULES**:
- Extract ONLY tasks that are explicitly mentioned
- DO NOT proactively create setup, preparatory, or follow-up tasks
- DO NOT fill gaps or add "missing" tasks
- ONLY exception: If user explicitly says "create setup tasks" or "add follow-up tasks"
- Consider existing tasks to avoid duplicates and understand project context

**Context Update Criteria** (Update context when):
1. Strategic insights or learnings emerge
2. Scope or boundaries change
3. New stakeholders or dependencies identified
4. Approach or methodology evolves
5. Risks or assumptions change
6. External factors shift
7. Major decisions made
8. **Project structure needs evolution** (add new sections, reorganize existing ones to better communicate the project's story)

**Don't Update Context For**:
- Simple task completions
- Minor status changes
- Day-to-day progress
- Temporary blockers

**Remember**: Context structure should evolve with the project. Don't be constrained by the initial framework - adapt it as the project's needs become clearer.

Otherwise, treat it as task-level updates only.

## Task Model:
tasks: {
  title: string (required, max 255),
  project_id: "c5340848-2264-4540-8789-beef44bcdf24" (required),
  description: string,
  details: string (specifics mentioned in braindump),
  status: "backlog"|"in_progress"|"done"|"blocked",
  priority: "low"|"medium"|"high",
  task_type: "one_off"|"recurring",
  duration_minutes?: number,
  start_date?: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS" (timestamptz - parse dates AND times, intelligently order tasks throughout the day e.g. "2024-03-15T09:00:00" for 9am, "2024-03-15T14:30:00" for 2:30pm, REQUIRED if task_type is "recurring"),
  recurrence_pattern?: "daily"|"weekdays"|"weekly"|"biweekly"|"monthly"|"quarterly"|"yearly" (REQUIRED if task_type is "recurring"),
  recurrence_ends?: "YYYY-MM-DD" (date only - parse from braindump or defaults to project end date if not specified),
  dependencies?: string[],
  parent_task_id?: string
}

## Date Parsing:
- "next week" → start_date: next Monday (calculate actual date)
   - "30 days" → end_date: 30 days from start_date (calculate actual date)
   - "3 months" → end_date: 3 months from start_date (calculate actual date)
   - "by end of month" → end_date: last day of current month
   - "in 2 weeks" → start_date: 2 weeks from today
   - "next Monday" → specific date of next Monday
   - "starting tomorrow" → start_date: tomorrow's date
   - "due Friday" → end_date: this Friday's date
   - "by Christmas" → end_date: 2025-12-25
   - "Q1" → end_date: March 31st of current year
   - "Q2" → end_date: June 30th of current year
   - Always calculate actual YYYY-MM-DD dates, NEVER use relative terms
   - If no timeline mentioned, use start_date: today, end_date: null
   - Current date context: Today is 2025-09-30

**RECURRING TASK RULES**:
- If a task mentions recurring patterns (daily, weekly, etc.), set task_type to "recurring"
- Recurring tasks MUST have a start_date (use today's date if not specified)
- Recurring tasks MUST have a recurrence_pattern matching the frequency mentioned
- If recurrence_ends is not mentioned, leave it null (will inherit from project end date)
- Examples:
  • "Review code every Friday" → task_type: "recurring", recurrence_pattern: "weekly", start_date: next Friday
  • "Daily standup" → task_type: "recurring", recurrence_pattern: "daily", start_date: tomorrow
  • "Monthly report" → task_type: "recurring", recurrence_pattern: "monthly", start_date: first of next month

## Generate Project Questions:
Generate 3-5 NEW questions that:
- Help the user think about the next steps based off of the project's current state and the new info coming from the braindump
- Help clarify vague aspects or ambiguous requirements
- Identify critical decisions that need to be made
- Break down complex problems into manageable steps
- Surface potential blockers, risks, or resource needs
- Move the project forward with concrete next steps

Questions should:
- Be specific and actionable and reference something specific in the project
- Spark creative thinking for productive future braindumps

Question categories:
- **clarification**: Define vague concepts
- **decision**: Force choices on open items
- **planning**: Break down large tasks
- **risk**: Identify potential obstacles
- **resource**: Clarify needs and constraints

Generate 3-5 NEW questions that help move the project forward based on the current state and new information from this braindump.

## Output JSON:
{
  "tasks": [
    // Array of task objects to create
  ],
  "requiresContextUpdate": boolean,
  "contextUpdateReason": "Which decision matrix criteria triggered update need (or null)",
  "projectQuestions": [
    {
      "question": "specific question text",
      "category": "clarification|decision|planning|risk|resource",
      "priority": "high|medium|low",
      "context": "why this matters now",
      "expectedOutcome": "what info this should produce"
    }
  ]
}

Focus on extracting actionable items. Only flag for context update if the braindump contains strategic changes matching the decision matrix.

Respond with valid JSON matching the Output JSON structure above.

## User Prompt

```
Process this braindump:

I want to explain to Avi about docs and how they are like onboarding docks that you would feed to a new hire and once you get these docs out you can do a bunch of automations that enable you to scale whatever is you're doing
