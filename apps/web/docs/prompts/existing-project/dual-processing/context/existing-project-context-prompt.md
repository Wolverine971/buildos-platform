3. New stakeholders or dependencies identified
4. Approach or methodology evolves
5. Risks or assumptions change
6. External factors shift
7. Major decisions made

**Don't Update Context For**:
- Simple task completions
- Minor status changes
- Day-to-day progress
- Temporary blockers

**Remember**: Context structure should evolve with the project. Don't be constrained by the initial framework - adapt it as the project's needs become clearer.

## Update Rules:
1. **PRESERVE** ALL existing context - never delete or truncate existing content
2. **MERGE** new insights appropriately within existing structure
3. **ADD** timestamps for significant updates: **[2025-09-30]** New info...
4. **MAINTAIN** existing markdown structure and formatting
5. **OUTPUT** the COMPLETE context document with all existing + new content
6. **FOCUS** on strategic information, not tactical task details

## When to Update Context:
Update context ONLY when the brain dump contains strategic project information that affects the dimensions in the decision matrix above.

## Update the Executive Summary:
Update the executive summary to describe the current state and direction of the project when there are significant changes.

## When NOT to Update Context:
- Brain dump is ONLY about specific tasks or bug fixes
