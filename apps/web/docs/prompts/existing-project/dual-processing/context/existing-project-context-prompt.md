**Context Update Criteria** (Update context when):
1. Strategic insights or learnings emerge
2. Scope or boundaries change
3. New stakeholders or dependencies identified
4. Approach or methodology evolves
5. Risks or assumptions change
6. External factors shift
7. Major decisions made
8. **Project structure needs evolution** (add new sections, reorganize existing ones to better communicate the project's story)

**Don't Update Context For**:
- Simple task completions
- Minor status changes
- Day-to-day progress
- Temporary blockers

**Remember**: Context structure should evolve with the project. Don't be constrained by the initial framework - adapt it as the project's needs become clearer.

## Update Rules:
1. **PRESERVE** ALL existing context - never delete or truncate existing content
2. **MERGE** new insights appropriately within existing structure
3. **ADD** timestamps for significant updates: **[2025-09-30]** New info...
4. **MAINTAIN** existing markdown structure and formatting
5. **OUTPUT** the COMPLETE context document with all existing + new content
6. **FOCUS** on strategic information, not tactical task details

## When to Update Context:
Update context ONLY when the brain dump contains strategic project information that affects the dimensions in the decision matrix above.

## Update the Executive Summary:
Update the executive summary to describe the current state and direction of the project when there are significant changes.

## When NOT to Update Context:
- Brain dump is ONLY about specific tasks or bug fixes
- Simple status updates or progress reports
- Day-to-day tactical information
- Information that belongs in task details instead
- Pure task lists or action items

## Output JSON for Context Update:
```json
{
  "title": "Short title for brain dump",
  "summary": "2-3 sentence summary of what was extracted from the braindump",
  "insights": "Key insights or highlights from this braindump",
  "tags": ["relevant", "tags"],
  "metadata": {
    "processingNote": "Explain why context was or wasn't updated"
  },
  "operations": [
    {
      "id": "op-[timestamp]-project-update",
      "table": "projects",
      "operation": "update",
      "data": {
        "id": "08439479-c5e4-40cb-bd04-f94cb97702a6",
        "context": "COMPLETE markdown with ALL existing content PLUS new updates...",
        "executive_summary": "Updated executive summary (only if project vision/scope changed)",
        "tags": ["updated", "tags", "if", "changed"],
        "status": "active|paused|completed|archived"
      }
    }
  ]
}
````

## Output JSON for No Context Update Needed:

```json
{
	"title": "Title for the braindump",
	"summary": "Summary of the braindump content",
	"insights": "Key insights from the content",
	"tags": ["relevant", "tags"],
	"metadata": {
		"processingNote": "No context update needed - [explain why: task-focused, progress update, etc.]"
	},
	"operations": []
}
```

Focus on strategic project information. Transform the brain dump into context updates or explain why no update is needed.

```

## User Prompt

```

Process this brain dump for project context:

"Got feedback from my critique group on chapters 1-3. Major revision needed.

Chapter 1 issues:

- Opening is too slow - start with action not description
- Elena needs stronger voice from page 1
- Cut the 3 pages of world history - weave it in later

Chapter 2 improvements needed:

- Master Thorne's dialogue too modern - needs more archaic feel
- Add scene showing Elena's daily forge work before the discovery
- The dragon forge discovery happens too easily - add obstacles

Chapter 3 restructure:

- Move the prophecy reveal to chapter 5
- Focus on Elena's emotional journey
- Add more conflict with Kai about her destiny

Also, writing style notes:

- Too many adverbs - search and destroy
- Vary sentence structure more
- Stop using 'suddenly' as a crutch
- Better sensory details in action scenes"
