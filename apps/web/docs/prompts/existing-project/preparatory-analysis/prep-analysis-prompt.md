## Analysis Criteria:

### Context Update Indicators (Strategic):
- Vision, mission, or goal changes
- Strategic pivots or new directions
- Scope expansions or reductions
- New insights about approach or methodology
- Market/competitive intelligence
- Stakeholder changes
- Risk identification
- Long-term planning updates
- Resource or budget discussions
- Architectural decisions

### Task-Related Indicators (Tactical):
- Specific task mentions by name or description
- Status updates on existing work
- Bug reports or fixes
- Implementation details
- Short-term action items
- Progress reports
- Technical specifications
- Daily/weekly activities
- Task dependencies or blockers

## Classification Rules:
- **strategic**: Primarily about project vision, direction, approach, or long-term planning
- **tactical**: Primarily about specific tasks, implementation, or short-term execution
- **mixed**: Contains both strategic and tactical elements
- **status_update**: Simple progress reports or status updates
- **unrelated**: Content doesn't relate to this project

## Task Matching:
Identify tasks that are likely referenced by looking for:
- Direct title matches or very similar titles
- Date references matching task dates
- Description keywords that align with task content
- Status changes mentioned for specific work
- Dependencies or relationships between tasks

## Output JSON Structure:

You MUST respond with valid JSON. Here are examples showing the VARIETY of possible outputs based on different braindump types:

**Example 1: Tactical Update (task-focused, skip context)**
```json
{
  "analysis_summary": "User providing status updates on API integration and database migration tasks",
  "braindump_classification": "tactical",
  "context_indicators": [],
  "relevant_task_ids": ["task-abc-123", "task-def-456"],
  "task_indicators": {
    "task-abc-123": "Mentioned completing API integration",
    "task-def-456": "Referenced database migration in progress"
  },
  "new_tasks_detected": false,
  "confidence_level": "high",
  "processing_recommendation": {
    "skip_context": true,
    "skip_tasks": false,
    "reason": "Only task updates, no strategic changes detected"
  }
}
```

**Example 2: Strategic Update (context-focused, update context)**
```json
{
  "analysis_summary": "User pivoting product strategy from B2C to B2B enterprise market",
  "braindump_classification": "strategic",
  "context_indicators": [
    "Major strategic pivot from B2C to B2B mentioned",
    "New enterprise requirements: SSO, multi-tenancy, admin controls",
    "Timeline extension by 2 months",
    "Scope change to focus on enterprise features"
  ],
  "relevant_task_ids": [],
  "task_indicators": {},
  "new_tasks_detected": true,
  "confidence_level": "high",
  "processing_recommendation": {
    "skip_context": false,
    "skip_tasks": false,
    "reason": "Strategic pivot requires context update and new task creation"
  }
}
```

**Example 3: Mixed Update (both strategic and tactical)**
```json
{
  "analysis_summary": "User discussing architecture refactor while updating task completion status",
  "braindump_classification": "mixed",
  "context_indicators": [
    "Architecture decision to break out authentication into microservice",
    "New microservices approach mentioned"
  ],
  "relevant_task_ids": ["task-xyz-789"],
  "task_indicators": {
    "task-xyz-789": "Database optimization task marked complete"
  },
  "new_tasks_detected": true,
  "confidence_level": "medium",
  "processing_recommendation": {
    "skip_context": false,
    "skip_tasks": false,
    "reason": "Contains both strategic architecture change and task updates"
  }
}
```

**Example 4: Simple Status Update (skip both)**
```json
{
  "analysis_summary": "Generic progress update with no specific details or actionable items",
  "braindump_classification": "status_update",
  "context_indicators": [],
  "relevant_task_ids": [],
  "task_indicators": {},
  "new_tasks_detected": false,
  "confidence_level": "medium",
  "processing_recommendation": {
    "skip_context": true,
    "skip_tasks": true,
    "reason": "Vague status update with no actionable information"
  }
}
```

**Example 5: Unrelated Content (skip all)**
```json
{
  "analysis_summary": "Content does not relate to this project's scope or objectives",
  "braindump_classification": "unrelated",
  "context_indicators": [],
  "relevant_task_ids": [],
  "task_indicators": {},
  "new_tasks_detected": false,
  "confidence_level": "high",
  "processing_recommendation": {
    "skip_context": true,
    "skip_tasks": true,
    "reason": "Content is not related to this project"
  }
}
```

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
- Choose the classification that BEST matches the braindump content
- Set skip_context to TRUE when context doesn't need updating
- Set skip_tasks to TRUE only for vague status updates with no task information
- Arrays and objects should be EMPTY [] or {} if nothing found
- Be CONSERVATIVE: when uncertain, process rather than skip
- The examples show the VARIETY of outputs - your response should match the actual content

**Important Rules:**
- braindump_classification: MUST be one of: "strategic", "tactical", "mixed", "status_update", "unrelated"
- new_tasks_detected: MUST be true or false (boolean)
- confidence_level: MUST be one of: "high", "medium", "low"
- skip_context: MUST be true or false (boolean)
- skip_tasks: MUST be true or false (boolean)

Analyze the braindump and respond with ONLY the JSON, no other text.

## User Prompt

```
Analyze this braindump:

"Got feedback from my critique group on chapters 1-3. Major revision needed.

Chapter 1 issues:

- Opening is too slow - start with action not description
- Elena needs stronger voice from page 1
- Cut the 3 pages of world history - weave it in later

Chapter 2 improvements needed:

- Master Thorne's dialogue too modern - needs more archaic feel
- Add scene showing Elena's daily forge work before the discovery
- The dragon forge discovery happens too easily - add obstacles

Chapter 3 restructure:

- Move the prophecy reveal to chapter 5
- Focus on Elena's emotional journey
- Add more conflict with Kai about her destiny

Also, writing style notes:

- Too many adverbs - search and destroy
- Vary sentence structure more
- Stop using 'suddenly' as a crutch
- Better sensory details in action scenes"
```
