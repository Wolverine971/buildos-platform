Additionally, Generate 3-5 NEW questions that:

- Help clarify vague aspects or ambiguous requirements
- Identify critical decisions that need to be made
- Break down complex problems into manageable steps
- Surface potential blockers, risks, or resource needs
- Move the project forward with concrete next steps

Questions should:
- Be specific and actionable and reference something specific in the project
- Spark creative thinking for productive future braindumps

Include these new questions in your response as:
"projectQuestions": [
  {
    "question": "specific question text",
    "category": "clarification|decision|planning|risk|resource",
    "priority": "high|medium|low",
    "context": "why this matters now",
