I'll research project context documentation best practices to help you create a universal framework that works across all project types.Based on my research into project documentation best practices, the USMC 5-paragraph order structure, and universal project frameworks, I've developed an abstract outline for project context documents that can work across any type of project - from software development to curriculum design to house renovations.

## Universal Project Context Document Framework

### 1. **SITUATION & ENVIRONMENT**

_Understanding the landscape and conditions_

- **Current State Analysis**
    - What exists now (baseline reality)
    - Pain points, gaps, or opportunities being addressed
    - Relevant history and prior attempts
- **Environmental Factors**
    - External forces and trends affecting the project
    - Organizational/cultural context
    - Regulatory, legal, or compliance considerations
- **Stakeholder Landscape**
    - Who is affected (directly and indirectly)
    - Their interests, influence, and expectations
    - Relationships and dependencies between stakeholders

### 2. **PURPOSE & VISION**

_The "why" and desired future state_

- **Core Purpose Statement**
    - Single, clear articulation of why this project exists
    - Problem being solved or opportunity being captured
- **Success Vision**
    - What "done" looks like
    - Measurable success criteria and indicators
    - Value delivered to stakeholders
- **Alignment & Strategic Fit**
    - How this connects to larger goals/initiatives
    - Dependencies with other projects or efforts

### 3. **SCOPE & BOUNDARIES**

_What's in and what's out_

- **Deliverables & Outcomes**
    - Tangible outputs to be produced
    - Intangible outcomes expected
    - Quality standards and acceptance criteria
- **Boundaries & Constraints**
    - What is explicitly NOT included
    - Resource limitations (time, budget, people, materials)
    - Technical or policy constraints
- **Key Assumptions**
    - What we're taking as given
    - Dependencies on external factors
    - Risk areas if assumptions prove false

### 4. **APPROACH & EXECUTION**

_How we'll get there_

- **Strategy & Methodology**
    - Overall approach and guiding principles
    - Phases, milestones, and checkpoints
    - Decision-making framework
- **Work Structure**
    - Major workstreams or components
    - Sequencing and dependencies
    - Critical path elements
- **Resource Plan**
    - People (roles, skills, availability)
    - Tools, systems, and infrastructure needed
    - Budget allocation approach

### 5. **COORDINATION & CONTROL**

_How we'll stay organized and aligned_

- **Governance Structure**
    - Decision rights and escalation paths
    - Review and approval processes
    - Change control mechanisms
- **Communication Framework**
    - Information flow patterns
    - Reporting cadence and formats
    - Feedback and input channels
- **Risk & Issue Management**
    - Known risks and mitigation strategies
    - Issue identification and resolution process
    - Contingency planning

### 6. **KNOWLEDGE & LEARNING**

_Building on past and informing future_

- **Lessons Applied**
    - Relevant insights from similar efforts
    - What we're doing differently this time
- **Documentation Standards**
    - What will be captured and how
    - Knowledge transfer approach
    - Archive and reference strategy
- **Continuous Improvement**
    - How we'll measure and learn during execution
    - Adaptation triggers and processes

## Why This Framework Works Universally

This structure adapts the military's SMEAC framework (Situation, Mission, Execution, Administration/Logistics, Command/Signal) while incorporating modern project management best practices. It's abstract enough to apply to any domain yet specific enough to ensure nothing critical is missed.

**Key strengths:**

- **Scalable** - Works for simple or complex projects
- **Domain-agnostic** - Marketing, coding, education, construction all fit
- **Action-oriented** - Focuses on decisions and execution
- **Context-rich** - Captures both internal and external factors
- **Learning-enabled** - Builds organizational knowledge

The framework ensures you define project scope, milestones, and success criteria while maintaining situational awareness - critical for any project regardless of domain.

Each section can be expanded or simplified based on project complexity, but having all six elements ensures comprehensive context that enables effective decision-making and execution.
