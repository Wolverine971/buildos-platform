# I Built an AI-Powered "Operating System" for My Chaotic Life (And You Can Try It Too)

I'm the kind of person who acts first and asks questions later. I've got coding projects, side hustles, two kids, a family, hobbies, home maintenance, and about a million ideas bouncing around in my head at any given moment. So being organized has always been a challenge for me. Thats why I decided to build a system that works for me.

Keeping all these projects aligned and moving forward without dropping the ball is a constant challenge. And I didn't like the traditional to-do apps. I needed a system that helps me capture ideas on the move and keeps me organzied. And thats why I decided to build a system that works for me. And I am calling it build-os.

**Build OS** is for the builders.

Build OS is built around a simple but powerful concept: **brain dumps â†’ structured projects**.

Think, an operating system for your life that uses AI to turn your scattered thoughts into organized action.

- **Capture everything** without losing ideas
- **Understand context** get AI to synthesize my different projects and goals
- **Generate actionable next steps** based off of the project's context
- **Keep me aligned** give reminders, ask for clarity, keep me on track

I am tired of checking my notes app on my phone, obsidian, slack, emails, and text messages. I wanted to create the one place where I could organize my ideas.

Here's how it works:

### 1. Brain Dump Everything

Instead of trying to organize your thoughts as you think them, just dump everything into Build OS. Raw thoughts, voice memos, random ideas - it all goes in.

### 2. AI Parses and Organizes

The system uses LLMs to automatically categorize your brain dumps into:

- **Life Goals** (long-term aspirations like "get off of energy drinks" or "launch my SaaS")
- **Projects** (capture the ideas, put the pieces together)
- **Tasks** (create the needed one-off actions or recurring habits)

### 3. Context-Aware Intelligence

Here's where it gets interesting. Build OS doesn't just create random to-do items. It maintains rich context about each project and goal, so when you mention "that React app I'm building," it immediately knows which project you're talking about and can add relevant tasks or updates.

### 4. Life Goals Integration

Beyond just projects, Build OS tracks your deeper life goals with rich context including your vision, current obstacles, required habits, and success metrics. Tell build-os your goals and it will keep you accountable.

## Different Modes for Different Needs

There are multiple "flavors" of Build OS in the works:

**Ruthless Prioritization Mode**: Constantly analyzes your task list and prompts you with "What should you do next?" It's like having a productivity coach that never lets you slack off.

**Research Assistant Mode**: Generates LLM prompts tailored to your current projects, helps you research effectively, then integrates your findings back into the system.

**Daily Brief Mode**: Each morning, get a personalized intelligence report covering goal progress, project status, priority tasks, and strategic recommendations.

## The Technical Stack

For the developers curious about the implementation:

- **Backend**: Supabase for data + vector embeddings for semantic search
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit + Tailwind
- **AI**: LLM integration for parsing brain dumps and generating insights
- **Architecture**: Centralized context engine that maintains knowledge about your personal history, working style, and current objectives

The system structures personal context into six key modules:

- Who I Am (background, values, personality)
- What I'm Building (active projects and goals)
- What I Believe (core philosophies and principles)
- How I Work (habits, workflows, preferences)
- What I Need Help With (blockers and collaboration needs)
- Life Goals + Projects (the main organizational layer)

## Real-World Impact

Since building Build OS, I've noticed:

- **Zero lost ideas**: Every random thought gets captured and properly categorized
- **Better project momentum**: The AI constantly suggests next steps, so projects don't stagnate
- **Improved alignment**: I can see how daily tasks connect to bigger life goals
- **Reduced mental overhead**: My brain doesn't need to hold onto everything anymore

## Want to Try It?

I'm looking for beta users to help stress-test Build OS and provide feedback. If you're someone who juggles multiple projects and struggles with organization, this might be exactly what you need.

**Beta users get**:

- 3 days completely free
- Special pricing: $10/month (this pricing is exclusive to beta users)
- Direct access to me for feedback and feature requests

The goal isn't to build another generic productivity app. It's to create an AI-powered command center that actually understands your life and helps you stay organized, aligned, and consistently moving forward.

Ready to turn your chaos into clarity?
