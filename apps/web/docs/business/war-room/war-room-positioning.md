### Layer 2: The Opportunity Frame (Gain Seeking)

**Headline**: "What If You Could See Around Corners?"

### Layer 3: The Identity Frame (Aspiration)

**Headline**: "Think Like a Chess Grandmaster"

_The best project leaders don't just planâ€”they anticipate. They see three moves ahead. They have contingencies for their contingencies._

### Layer 4: The Innovation Frame (Early Adopter)

**Headline**: "The Future of Project Planning Is Interactive"
