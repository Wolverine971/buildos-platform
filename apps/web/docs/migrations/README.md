# Active Migrations & Progress Tracking

This directory contains documentation of active migrations, refactoring efforts, and ongoing implementation phases that are in progress or recently completed.

## 📋 Current Active Migrations

### Phase-Based Implementation Tracking

This directory tracks the progress of major implementation phases and migrations:

- **Phase 1, 2, 3**: Major feature implementations and system updates
- **Type System Updates**: Type safety improvements and fixes
- **Performance Optimizations**: Speed and efficiency improvements
- **Store Structure**: Application state management changes

## 📂 Directory Structure

The `/migrations/active/` directory (if it exists) contains:

```
/migrations/
├── README.md (this file)
└── /active/  (if present)
    ├── [Various migration tracking documents]
```

## 🔍 What This Contains

Migration documents typically track:
- Implementation progress (percentage complete)
- Files changed and updated
- Tests added or modified
- Known issues and workarounds
- Rollback procedures if needed
- Performance impact analysis

## 🎯 How to Use

### Finding Active Work
1. Check directory for current migration documents
2. Look for files with `PHASE_`, `PROGRESS_`, or `STATUS_` prefixes
3. Review dates - most recent is most current

### Understanding a Migration
1. Read the document title for quick context
2. Check status section (% complete)
3. Review files affected
4. Check for known issues
5. Look for rollback procedures

### Contributing to a Migration
1. Find the migration document
2. Update progress section
3. Note files you've changed
4. Document any issues found
5. Add tests for your changes

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Active migrations** are ongoing work
- **Recent migrations** may have workarounds or known issues
- **Rollback procedures** should be documented for reversibility
- **Communication** is key when working with active migrations
