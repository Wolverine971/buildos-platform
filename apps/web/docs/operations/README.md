## üöÄ Deployment Workflow

### Before Deploying

1. **Verify Readiness**: Follow [READY_TO_DEPLOY.md](deployment/READY_TO_DEPLOY.md)
    - All tests passing
    - No type errors
    - Code reviewed
    - Performance acceptable

2. **Review Configuration**: Check [VERCEL_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md](deployment/VERCEL_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md)
    - Environment variables set
    - Build settings correct
    - Deployment target verified

3. **Prepare Deployment**:
    - Create deployment branch
    - Tag release
    - Notify team

### Deploying

1. Push to deployment branch (usually `main` for Vercel auto-deploy)
2. Vercel automatically triggers build
3. Monitor build logs
4. Verify deployment succeeds

### After Deployment

1. Run smoke tests
2. Check error logs
3. Verify key features working
4. Monitor metrics

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:

1. Check [VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md](deployment/VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md)
2. Review build logs in Vercel dashboard
3. Check environment variables
4. Verify dependencies installed correctly

- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Feature flags set correctly

### Deployment

- [ ] Deploy to staging (if applicable)
- [ ] Run smoke tests

## üîß Key Configuration Files

The following files control Vercel deployment:

| File                  | Location     | Purpose                       |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `vercel.json`         | Project root | Vercel build configuration    |
| `.env.example`        | Project root | Environment variable template |
| `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | Project root | Monorepo configuration        |

## üìù Notes

- Vercel auto-deploys from `main` branch
- Environment variables managed in Vercel dashboard
- Build command: `pnpm turbo build --filter=@buildos/web`
- Output directory: `apps/web/.svelte-kit`
- All deployments run full test suite first
