# Template Analyzer Braindump Samples

Ten representative prompts to manually exercise the analyzer across scopes, realms, and nuance cases. Each sample includes the assumed scope, realm, optional domain, and the raw braindump content.

---

## 1. Project — AI Ghostwriting Studio (Realm: content_ops)
```
"We run a boutique ghostwriting studio for technical founders. Need a reusable project template for new client engagements: initial discovery, voice calibration, weekly chapter delivery, async reviews, and final polish. Must track editing capacity, sourced research artifacts, and stakeholder feedback loops. Typical variant is long-form book projects across fintech-focused founders."
```

## 2. Plan — Discovery Sprint (Realm: product_ops)
```
"Looking for a plan template that guides a 10-day discovery sprint for SaaS teams. Steps: hypothesis backlog, customer interview pairs, opportunity mapping, decision retro. Each stage needs exit criteria, recommended artifacts, and progress signals so PMs can reuse it without reinvention."
```

## 3. Task — SDR Follow-Up (Realm: revenue_ops, Domain: sales_rep)
```
"Need a repeatable task template for SDRs doing second-touch outreach after webinar registrations. Include CTA variants, personalization checklist, CRM notes to capture, and criteria for escalating to AE. Should specify done definition + timebox (under 15 minutes)."
```

## 4. Output — Competitive Brief (Realm: go_to_market)
```
"Marketing leads want a competitive teardown deliverable for AI writing tools. Sections: positioning snapshot, pricing matrix, feature velocity, partner ecosystem, risks. Must flag data sources, freshness date, and scoring rubric so analyst outputs are consistent."
```

## 5. Document — SOC2 Evidence Playbook (Realm: compliance_ops)
```
"Create a document template for SOC2 evidence gathering SOP. Needs sections for control families, artifact examples, responsible roles, retention policy, and review cadence. Also include checklist for new hires to audit gaps."
```

## 6. Goal — Churn Reduction (Realm: success_ops)
```
"Need a goal template tracked quarterly: churn reduction for B2B SaaS accounts under $10k MRR. Include KPI definition, leading indicators (NPS dip, support backlog), owner, review cadence, thresholds for green/yellow/red, and required remediation actions."
```

## 7. Requirement — ML Model Latency (Realm: platform_ai)
```
"Project-derived requirement for sub-250ms response time on inference endpoints supporting narrative generation. Document acceptable hardware profiles, monitoring hooks, rollback plan if SLA breached, and dependency on vendor GPU quotas."
```

## 8. Risk — Vendor Lock-In (Realm: platform_ai)
```
"Recurring risk template: dependency on a single LLM provider. Need likelihood scale, impact description (cost spikes, outages), mitigation playbook (warm backup provider, abstraction layer tests), and owner. Triggered whenever a project exceeds 70% usage from one vendor."
```

## 9. Metric — Activation Rate (Realm: onboarding_ops)
```
"Metric template for onboarding projects measuring user activation within 7 days. Includes formula, data sources, instrumentation checklist, acceptable ranges, alert thresholds, and notes on when to run deeper cohort analysis."
```

## 10. Task Variant — QA Regression Sweep (Realm: engineering_ops, Domain: qa_lead)
```
"Need a specialized task variant for QA leads running regression sweeps before AI agent deploys. Steps: sync test cases from notion, run automation suite, capture anomalies, tag root cause, schedule fix window. Must include environment matrix and acceptance bar."
```
