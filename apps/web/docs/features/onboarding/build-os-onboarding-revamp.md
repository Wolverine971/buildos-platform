# 🚀 BuildOS Onboarding Flow (Refined)

## 1. Welcome & Orientation

- **Message**: “Welcome to BuildOS — your AI-first project organization tool. Let’s set you up so BuildOS works the way _you_ want.”
- **CTA**: “Start Setting Up”

---

## 2. Capture Current Projects (Guided Brain Dump)

<!--
capture goals
what are you trying to get done, what goals you have, deadlines you have, what are you trying to get done -->

Instead of just asking “What projects are you working on,” BuildOS will **guide them through examples** to encourage freeform capture.

- **Prompt**: _“Let’s start by getting everything out of your head. What projects are you working on right now? Don’t worry about structure — just brain dump.”_

- **Examples shown**:
    - 🏋️ _Fitness Project_: “Keep track of my workout routine, meal planning, and schedule.”
    - 💻 _Side Project_: “I’m trying to bootstrap a small app and need to track milestones.”
    - 📚 _Writing a Book_: “Capture all my ideas, research, and outlines in one place.”

- **Integration Option**:
    - _“Want BuildOS to analyze your Google Calendar and suggest projects from your schedule?”_
    - CTA: **Connect Google Calendar**

👉 **Value**: They immediately see how BuildOS converts their raw notes (and calendar events) into structured projects.

## 3. Accountability & Notifications Setup

Here, you frame BuildOS as a **personal AI assistant that adapts to their preference**.

- **Prompt**: _“How do you want BuildOS to keep you accountable?”_
- **Options (Phone Number Required for Texts):**
    1. 📅 _Event Reminders_: Text me about big upcoming events.
    2. ⏰ _Next Up Notifications_: Text me what’s next on my schedule.
    3. 🌅 _Morning Kickoff_: Text me in the morning to set the tone for the day.
    4. 🌙 _Evening Recap_: Text me at night to reflect on what I got done.

      <!-- ask user what they accomplished based off of what i told you earlier today, also here are the next things you have coming up -->

- **Other Channel**:
    - ✉️ _Daily Briefs (Email)_: A morning digest with your upcoming projects & tasks. (Toggle opt-in)

---

## 4. BuildOS Usage Profile (User Archetypes)

This is where you discover **how they see BuildOS fitting into their life**.

- **Prompt**: _“Everyone uses BuildOS differently. How do you want to use it?”_
- **Options (with icons & microcopy):**
    1. 🧠 _Second Brain_: Capture ideas, notes, and information.
    2. 🤖 _AI Task Manager_: Keep me prepared for meetings, deadlines, and next steps.
    3. ✅ _Project To-Do List_: Simple task organization to keep projects moving.

👉 These profiles help shape the **default BuildOS experience** they see first.

---

## 5. Identify Productivity Challenges

This creates empathy and personalization.

- **Prompt**: _“What’s your biggest challenge with productivity or organization?”_
- **Suggestions to pick from (multi-select allowed):**
    - ⏳ Time management — I run out of hours in the day.
    - 🧩 Focus/ADHD — I struggle with follow-through.
    - 🔀 Context switching — I juggle too many things at once.
    - 📅 Planning — I struggle to break big goals into actionable steps.
    - 📈 Accountability — I need someone/something to keep me on track.
    - 📝 Information overload — I have notes everywhere and no system.
    - 😰 Overwhelm — I don’t even know where to start.

<!-- add snippets and helpful hints -->

👉 **Value**: BuildOS can later adapt suggestions and tone based on these answers.

---

## 6. Summary & First Win

Show a confirmation page where BuildOS reflects back what it learned:

- ✅ Projects captured (brain dump + calendar)
- ✅ Accountability style selected
- ✅ Usage profile chosen
- ✅ Challenges identified

CTA: **“Enter BuildOS”** → takes them into their workspace with projects already seeded.
