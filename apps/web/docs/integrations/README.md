# Integrations Documentation

Stripe integration docs now live in the monorepo documentation hub at /docs/integrations/stripe/.

Use this directory for app-specific addenda only. When creating integration docs, add them under /docs/integrations/ so they are discoverable from the root documentation index, and link to them from feature-specific guides in /apps/web/docs/features/ when additional context is needed.

See /docs/integrations/README.md for the current list of supported integrations and navigation guidance.
