Subject: AI-Native Individual Productivity Platform - ClickUp Evolution Path

Hi David,

BuildOS is an AI-native productivity platform for individual users with
strong early consumer metrics and clear enterprise expansion potential.

Key business highlights:
• $XXK MRR growing XX% month-over-month with individual subscriptions
• XX% trial-to-paid conversion and <X% monthly churn
• Strong user engagement: XX daily active sessions, XX% AI feature adoption
• Early team collaboration interest showing enterprise expansion potential

Our approach mirrors ClickUp's evolution from individual productivity to
enterprise platform, but built AI-first from the ground up rather than
adding AI features to traditional project management.

Given Craft's ClickUp investment and focus on AI-powered category-defining
software, would love to share our individual user metrics and B2B expansion
roadmap.

Best,
[Founder Name]

## Summary Score: 🟡 **Medium Priority Target**

Craft Ventures presents mixed alignment for BuildOS given their strong B2B software focus, while BuildOS is currently individual-focused. However, their ClickUp investment shows understanding of individual-to-enterprise productivity platform evolution, and their AI investment thesis could support BuildOS's positioning.

**Success Probability**: Medium (B2B focus conflicts with current B2C stage)
**Strategic Value**: High (if aligned - ClickUp insights + AI expertise + scaling experience)
**Timeline**: 8-10 weeks to investment decision

**Critical Success Factor**: Position BuildOS as following ClickUp's evolution path from individual to enterprise, with AI-native competitive advantage. Must demonstrate strong individual user metrics and clear B2B expansion roadmap.

**Recommendation**: Target as Series A investor rather than seed, when enterprise expansion is more developed, or approach now if individual user metrics and B2B roadmap are exceptionally strong.
