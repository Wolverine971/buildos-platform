## Implementation Details

### API Endpoint

**File:** `/routes/api/admin/llm-usage/stats/+server.ts`

**Method:** GET

**Query Params:**

- `days` - Number of days to look back (default: 30)

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "overview": { ... },
    "dailyData": [ ... ],
    "modelBreakdown": [ ... ],
    "operationBreakdown": [ ... ],
    "topUsers": [ ... ],
    "recentLogs": [ ... ],
    "dateRange": { ... }
  }
}
```

### Database Functions

Added to migration SQL:

#### `get_admin_model_breakdown()`

```sql
get_admin_model_breakdown(p_start_date, p_end_date)
```

Returns aggregated stats per model.

#### `get_admin_operation_breakdown()`

```sql
get_admin_operation_breakdown(p_start_date, p_end_date)
```

Returns aggregated stats per operation type.

#### `get_admin_top_users()`

```sql
get_admin_top_users(p_start_date, p_end_date, p_limit)
```

Returns top users by cost with a configurable limit.

### Security

- **RLS Policies:** All data queries respect Row Level Security
- **Admin Check:** Route requires user to exist in `admin_users` table
- **Server-Side:** All queries executed server-side for security

## Setup

### 1. Run Migration

The migration at `apps/web/supabase/migrations/llm_usage_tracking.sql` now includes:

- Main tables
- Admin RPC functions (added)
- Admin views

### 2. Grant Admin Access

To grant admin access to a user:

```sql
INSERT INTO admin_users (user_id, granted_by)
VALUES ('user-uuid-here', 'admin-uuid-here');
```

### 3. Access Dashboard

Navigate to: `https://yourapp.com/admin/llm-usage`

## Usage Examples

### Monitoring Costs

1. Select time range (e.g., "Last 30 days")
2. Check "Total Cost" card for overall spend
3. Review "Cost Over Time" chart for trends
4. Check "Model Breakdown" to see which models are most expensive
5. Review "Top Users" to identify high-usage accounts

### Identifying Issues

1. Check "Success Rate" in overview - should be >95%
2. Review "Recent Activity" for failed requests
3. Check "Avg Response Time" - spikes may indicate performance issues
4. Filter to specific time periods to isolate issues

### Optimizing Costs

1. Review "Model Breakdown" - identify expensive models
2. Check "Operation Breakdown" - see which operations cost most
3. Review "Top Users" - identify users with high costs
4. Analyze if cheaper models can be used for specific operations

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:

- **Export functionality** - Download reports as CSV/PDF
- **Real-time updates** - Auto-refresh dashboard
- **Advanced filters** - Filter by model, operation, user
- **Cost forecasting** - Predict future costs based on trends
- **Alerts setup** - Email notifications for cost thresholds
- **Custom date ranges** - Specific start/end dates
- **Comparison views** - Compare periods (week over week, etc.)
- **Provider breakdown** - Group by AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Interactive charts** - Zoom, pan, tooltips
- **Error analysis** - Detailed breakdown of failures

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. **Monthly Review**
    - Check total costs vs budget
    - Review model performance
    - Identify optimization opportunities

2. **User Management**
    - Monitor top users
    - Address unusually high usage
    - Set up cost alerts if needed

3. **Performance Monitoring**
    - Track response times
    - Monitor success rates
    - Investigate failures

### Troubleshooting

**Dashboard not loading?**

- Check admin access in database
- Verify migration ran successfully
- Check browser console for errors

**Data seems incorrect?**

- Verify `llm_usage_summary` table is being updated (trigger should auto-update)
- Check if logging is working in `SmartLLMService`
- Run summary update manually:
    ```sql
    SELECT update_llm_usage_summary('user-id', '2025-09-30');
    ```

**Performance issues?**

- Reduce time range
- Check database indexes
- Consider archiving old logs

The dashboard displays:

- **Top:** 6 metric cards in a responsive grid
- **Middle:** 2 bar charts side by side
