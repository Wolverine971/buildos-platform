There is some invalidation that happens on this page. And when that happens the page jumps and a user might lose his place. For example if certain phase cards are expanded they might collapse. I want to be able to not lose my place and for the page to gracefully update.

So to do that I was thinking of keeping track of phases that are expanded and collapsed and the filters that are applied on them.
