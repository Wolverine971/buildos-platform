## Notes for Writing

**What makes this blog unique**: Most deep work content assumes you have control over your environment and schedule. This blog acknowledges real constraints (meetings, interruptions, ADHD, energy limitations) and provides **practical workarounds**, not just ideal-world advice.

**Tone balance**: Empathetic about how hard focus is, practical about real-world constraints, empowering about what's possible even with limitations.

**Key differentiator**: Integration of focus time into a systematic productivity approach (BuildOS), not just willpower or "here are tips." Show how **tools can actively support focus**, not just rely on discipline.

**Reader takeaway**:
1. Understand their personal focus landscape (when, where, how long)
2. Have concrete strategies to protect and maximize focus time
3. Know how to use BuildOS features to support focus
4. Feel empowered that focus is achievable, not just for "other people"

**ADHD-specific value**: Many focus articles ignore ADHD or treat it as "just try harder." This blog should **explicitly address ADHD strategies** and acknowledge different focus challenges.

**Honest about challenges**:
- Focus is genuinely hard in modern work environment
- Some roles have severe focus limitations (customer support, etc.)
- Energy limitations are real (chronic illness, parenting, etc.)
- Not everyone can get 4-hour focus blocks

**Practical focus**: Every section should have **actionable takeaways**. This is a "do this" blog, not a "think about this" blog.

**Connection to BuildOS**: Show how BuildOS **actively supports focus**:
- Calendar integration protects focus blocks
- AI identifies deep work tasks
- Daily briefs suggest focus time priorities
- Phases help structure multi-day focus projects

**Success metric**: If readers finish this blog and immediately schedule one protected focus block this week, it's working.
