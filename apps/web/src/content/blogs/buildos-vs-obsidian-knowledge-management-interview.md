## Notes for Completion

**Respectful tone**: Obsidian has a passionate community. Don't be dismissive. Steel-man their position.

**Philosophical depth**: This comparison is about different philosophies of knowledge work. Go deep on this.

**Embedded questions**: Each `<!-- Q# -->` comment needs specific content addressing that question.

**PKM credibility**: Show understanding of Personal Knowledge Management principles and respect for that community.

**Honest about trade-offs**: Local storage vs. cloud AI is a real trade-off. Don't hand-wave it.

**Use case specificity**: Be very clear about when each tool excels. Academic research? Obsidian probably wins. Execution-focused project management? BuildOS wins.

**Visual needs**:
- Spectrum diagram (curator ↔ achiever)
- Feature comparison table
- Workflow comparison
- Decision tree

**Quotes and testimonials**: Add real voices from people who've used both tools.

**The "both" strategy**: Many people might use Obsidian for long-term knowledge and BuildOS for day-to-day execution. Develop this angle.

**Future-proofing section**: Address the "what if BuildOS disappears" concern directly. This matters to knowledge workers.

**Call to action**: What should readers do? Try BuildOS? Keep Obsidian? Use both? Give clear guidance based on their needs.

**Link strategy**: Link to Obsidian respectfully, PKM resources, BuildOS docs, other comparison blogs.

**SEO considerations**: This will rank for "Obsidian alternative", "second brain tools", "PKM software" - make it comprehensive.
