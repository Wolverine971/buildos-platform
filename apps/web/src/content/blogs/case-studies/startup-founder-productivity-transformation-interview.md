## Notes

**Founder empathy**: This audience is uniquely overwhelmed. Deep empathy for impossible demands.

**High stakes**: Unlike other use cases, founder decisions have company-level consequences. Show how BuildOS handles high-pressure decision-making.

**Multi-project mastery**: The key value for founders is seeing across ALL projects in daily brief. This is the killer feature for this persona.

**Sustainable pace**: Don't glorify hustle culture. Show how BuildOS enables sustainable founder performance, not just "do more."

**Credibility**: Founder audience is skeptical. Need real metrics, real outcomes, real founder voice.

**Differentiation**: Why BuildOS for founders vs. Notion/Asana/Linear? The daily brief across projects + brain dump for founder thinking is unique value.
