## Why I Built BuildOS

I hated having to repeat myself multiple times in different chats. Every new conversation meant starting from scratch—explaining the same context, the same goals, the same constraints. I wanted to build upon my last conversation and actually make progress.

That's why I built BuildOS.

I was thinking about how LLMs are smart, but they need a bit of structure to be truly powerful. And because I had tried other productivity tools and project management systems, I had opinions about what was broken.

I wanted it to be **simple**. I wanted to be able to just chat about what I wanted and have the AI do what I tell it. Simple enough.

I wanted the AI to be able to **reference things we previously talked about** in a project. Simple enough.

I wanted to be able to **make a plan and then get help following through** with that plan.

I wanted the AI to **help me clarify my thinking** and be a thought partner as I built my empire.

So yeah, that's why I built BuildOS.

## How It Works

It works by you chatting with BuildOS.

### Creating a New Project

There's a flow for creating a project where you just describe:

- What the project is
- What your goals are
- Where you currently are

That's it. No forms. No templates to fill out. Just talk.

### Working in an Existing Project

There's also a flow for working in an existing project. You can enter from any point of view:

- Start by **defining goals** or mentioning new plans
- Talk about specific **milestones** you want to hit
- Work on specific **tasks** that need doing
- Create **docs** you'll need later
- Discuss **risks** that could derail your project—BuildOS will help you work on risk mitigation

The idea is for BuildOS to be your thought partner. It helps keep you focused and accountable.

**Come as you are.**

## Beyond the Chat

Apart from the chat, you have a **project view** where you can mess with the individual pieces—like you would in a typical project organization app.

The cool thing is that you can start chatting with BuildOS about any particular piece whenever it comes up.

BuildOS is meant to be flexible and meet you where you are. It goes with how your brain works. Start where you want to start.

## Other Things That Help

**Daily Briefs**: You get a high-level overview of what you've got going on. It's like having a personal assistant who actually knows your projects.

**Text Message Reminders**: We can send you SMS reminders for important tasks or calendar events coming up. Never miss the important stuff.

## That's How BuildOS Works

Simple. Flexible. Built for how your brain actually works.

No more repeating yourself. No more starting from zero. Just continuous progress on the things that matter.
