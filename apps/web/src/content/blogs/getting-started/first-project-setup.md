Creating a project in BuildOS works how software should work: you tell it what you want to build. No forms. No templates. No structure to define upfront.

Open the chat, describe your project, and BuildOS figures out the rest.

## How It Actually Works

### Step 1: Open the Chat

Click the chat icon or press your keyboard shortcut. You'll see a context selector. Choose "Create Project" to let BuildOS know you're starting something new.

### Step 2: Describe What You Want to Build

Just say it. Type naturally, like you're explaining your idea to a smart friend.

**Examples that work well:**

- "I'm building a mobile app for tracking fitness workouts"
- "I want to write a novel about time travel, probably 60k words"
- "I'm launching a newsletter about AI tools for small businesses"
- "I need to plan my wedding for October"
- "I'm starting a consulting business on the side"

You don't need perfect clarity. BuildOS will ask if it needs more.

### Step 3: Answer Clarifying Questions (Maybe)

If your description is clear enough, BuildOS just creates the project. If not, it asks one or two focused questions. Never more than two rounds.

**What BuildOS might ask:**

- "What kind of project is this: a product you're building, something you're writing, or a business initiative?"
- "What's the main thing you're trying to create or accomplish?"
- "Do you have a deadline in mind?"

Answer naturally. If you realize mid-conversation that you described the wrong thing, just say so: "Actually, let me start over. This is really about X." BuildOS adjusts based on what you tell it.

### Step 4: Your Project Appears

Once BuildOS has enough context, it creates your project with:

- **Goals**: What you're trying to accomplish
- **Tasks**: Concrete next steps to get started
- **Documents**: A place to capture context, notes, and reference material
- **The right structure**: Organized based on what kind of project it is

The chat shifts to your new project, and you can immediately start working.

## What BuildOS Creates for You

When you describe a project, BuildOS creates several things to help you work:

**Projects** are the container. Everything else lives inside a project.

**Goals** are what you're trying to achieve. A novel project might have "Complete first draft" and "Get three beta readers." A startup project might have "Validate the idea" and "Get first paying customer."

**Tasks** are things you can check off. BuildOS generates starter tasks based on your project type and goals.

**Documents** hold notes, research, and reference material. Your project gets a context document by default.

**Plans** group related tasks when you need more structure. Think of them as lightweight phases you create when you need them.

These connect naturally: tasks support goals, documents provide context, plans organize related work. Complete a task that supports a goal and you see progress. Add notes to a document and that context surfaces when you're working on related tasks.

## A Real Example

Say you tell BuildOS: "I want to learn Spanish to conversational fluency by the end of the year."

BuildOS recognizes this as a learning project with a deadline and creates:

- **Goals**: "Reach conversational level" and "Build vocabulary foundation"
- **Tasks**: Research learning methods, choose primary resource (app, tutor, class), set up daily practice routine, find conversation partners or tutors
- **Documents**: A context document for tracking resources, vocabulary notes, and progress observations

The structure matches what you're actually doing. A product launch would get different goals (market validation, user acquisition) and different tasks (define timeline, create marketing assets, set up analytics). A novel would get writing-specific structure (drafting phases, revision goals, beta reader tracking).

## Why Conversation Works Better Than Forms

You can express nuance that forms can't capture: "I want to write a novel, probably literary fiction, maybe 60k words, exploring themes of memory and identity."

A form would make you pick from dropdown menus. A conversation lets you explain what you actually mean. BuildOS adapts the structure to what you're building. A novel project looks different from a product launch because they're different kinds of work.

## After Your Project Exists

Once created, you keep working through the same chat interface. Here's what that looks like:

> **You:** "I just realized I need to research visa requirements before I can plan the trip details."
>
> **BuildOS:** "Got it. I'll add a task for visa research and move it before the booking tasks since it's a blocker."

> **You:** "Actually, I want to split this into two phases: research phase and booking phase."
>
> **BuildOS:** "Done. I've created two plans: 'Research' with your visa and destination tasks, and 'Booking' with flights, hotels, and activities."

You can also work directly in the project view. Check off tasks, edit details, add notes to documents. The chat and the direct interface work together.

## Tips for Good Project Descriptions

**Be specific about what you're making:**

- "I'm building an iOS app for habit tracking" works better than "I want to make an app"

**Include context when relevant:**

- "I'm writing a 50k word romance novel, aiming to self-publish on Amazon" works better than "I want to write a book"

**Mention constraints if you have them:**

- "I need to launch this marketing campaign by March 15" works better than "I need to do some marketing"

But don't stress about perfection. If you're vague, BuildOS asks. That's the point.

## Common Questions

### "What if I don't know exactly what I'm building yet?"

Start anyway. Describe what you know: "I want to start some kind of side business, probably in the AI space, not sure exactly what yet." BuildOS creates a lightweight structure for exploration. You evolve it as you learn more.

### "What if BuildOS misunderstands my project?"

Tell it. Say "This isn't quite right, it's more of a learning project than a business project" and BuildOS adjusts. You can also edit directly: delete tasks that don't apply, rename goals, add what's missing. The initial structure is a starting point, not a commitment.

### "Can I change everything later?"

Yes. Add goals, remove tasks, create new documents, reorganize plans. Nothing is locked in.

### "How is this different from brain dumps?"

Brain dumps capture scattered thoughts that might span multiple projects or just need processing. Project creation is for when you know you want to start something specific. They're complementary. You might brain dump to discover a project idea, then create the project through the chat.

## Your First Project: Just Try It

The best way to understand this is to do it. Open the chat, select "Create Project," and describe something you actually want to work on.

Start with something concrete: that side project you've been meaning to organize, that trip you need to plan, that skill you want to learn. Describe it in a sentence or two.

If you don't like what you get, edit it or delete it and try again. The first project takes about 30 seconds.
