## Notes for Writing

**What makes this blog unique**: Most PKM future content focuses on features and technology. We should focus on the **philosophical shift** - how the relationship between humans and their knowledge is fundamentally changing.

**Tone balance**: Enthusiastic about possibilities but honest about challenges. Avoid sounding like a vendor pitch.

**Key differentiator**: Emphasize BuildOS's focus on **action** and **execution**, not just knowledge preservation. This is what distinguishes us from pure PKM tools.

**Reader takeaway**: After reading, the reader should understand why current PKM systems feel inadequate and feel excited (not anxious) about the future of AI-assisted knowledge management.

my answers

Here's the answers for the Future of Personal Knowledge Management blog article interview questions:

1. **What frustrates you most about current note-taking and knowledge management systems?** (Looking for authentic pain points)

I feel like the way I take notes is very random, sporadic, or in the moment. For example, sometimes I record self talking videos or voice notes, sometimes I email myself or text myself, sometimes I take screenshots of inspiration or ideas I like, sometimes I email myself or make trello card. The biggest pain point is the way I take notes is very dependent on the moment, where I am, what I'm doing, or what sparked the idea or thought. At the end of the day, they're all disconnected. There's no central place I can link all of those various things to, so that when I take a note in whatever format, it gets sync'd up to a central database where I can access them all at the same time. Additionally, when trying to setup central spots to do something like this, such as Trello, Obsidian, or ClickUp, the initial work/setup is just too overwhelming, so I ultimately end up not doing it or using the platform. I work well when I have enough structure to keep me focused and on track, but not being so structured that I feel locked in to being required to do certain things at certain times.

2. **When was the last time you struggled to find something you knew you had written down?** What made it hard to find?

Probably within the last week. As mentioned in the previous question, I take a lot of notes using a lot of different methods. So sometimes I text myself, othertimes I email myself, or save the note in an app like Trello, or even in a Google Docs document. I would like a tool or platform that I can email, text, and sync up my Google Docs to, or upload audio or video to, that could act as a central hub to ingest my content wherever/however I create it.

3. **How much time do you currently spend organizing notes vs. actually using them?** Do you feel that balance is right?

I spend WAYYY more time organizing notes than actually using them. By the time I ever get things finally organized, I'm usually so mentally exhausted from the process that I either don't have the mental energy to do anything with them, or I've gotten bored with that particular topic or goal (or more interested in something new) that I've moved on to the next thing, where the cycle starts all over again.

4. **Have you tried any AI-powered knowledge tools? What worked and what didn't?**

I've tried a few tools that were not AI-native, but have since built in AI-related features, like Trello. Trello has now built in a "user email inbox" feature where you can send emails to your personal trello inbox email, and their AI will try to turn your email into a note for you, for you to manually organize and expand upon later. I love this concept, where you can just send info to your database, and then deal with it later. I think I tend to send myself texts notes more though, so I didn't stick with using the email very long, and it still includes the process of having to manually review it later. So once it stacked up, it became overwhelming and I abandoned it. Additionally, I've briefly tried using Vectal, which I really love at first glance. I like that it has a built in chat window, so instead of having to jump back and forth between ChatGPT and my To Do list app, its all in one, and I could essentially have a convo with ChatGPT and then turn that convo into actionable tasks being tracked in the lsit. Additionally, it's tasks use a Priority system moreso than a scheduled date and time system for getting tasks done, which works really well for someone like me who doesn't like being required to work on a specific task at a specific time, but rather finds time to get work done and then wants to work on whatever project I want to at that time, but still keep making progress towards my end goals by always focusing on the current highest priority task for that goal or project.

5. **What would make your current knowledge system 10x more valuable to you?**

I imagine my perfect knowledge system would include the best of all the apps mentioned previously: an "intake/ingest" ability where I can text, email, or voice note any of my thoughts, ideas, or notes to it, and it intelligently decides whether this is something related to something I'm already working on, or if its something entirely new; the ability to do all my writing, planning, and organizing within the app itself and not having to jump between different apps (AI Chat, plus task manager/to do list, plus project/progress tracking); and the ability to have enough structure that I know what tasks need to be done, and can either view tasks for a specific goal or project, or view all my tasks across all projects, but then decide what I want to work on based on project or niche (ie music vs business vs fitness) and then have the app tell me what the next task is in my list that is the highest priority or will move the needle the most in reference to getting me closer to my end goal.

### Vision & Future Thinking

6. **If you could wave a magic wand, how would your ideal knowledge management system work?** Walk me through a specific scenario.

If I could wave a magic wand, I’d want to capture ideas exactly as they come to me, without worrying about format or where to put them. Let’s say I’m driving and a business idea pops into my head, I could just voice record it, and it would automatically land in my system. Later, when I open the app, that idea would already be categorized, maybe even connected to similar notes I made last week. Then, instead of me staring at a pile of random notes, the system would say: “Here are the three most actionable things you could do with this idea today.” It would feel like a creative partner that both organizes and nudges me toward execution, without me lifting a finger to organize.

7. **What scares you about AI managing your knowledge?** What excites you about it?

I wouldn't say there's necessarily anything that outright scares me about AI managing my knowledge so much as my only concern is that it won't always interpret things the way I always give them, or might change the way I say things. For example, I might want to remember a quote from somebody for later use in a piece of content, and If I were to send that to my AI, I don't want it to accidentally re-write the quote thinking its providing more context, when in actuality I wanted the quote as is. I also fear losing information. By “giving up control” for lack of a better term, of the management of my info or things I want to remember, I feel like I run the risk of actually losing things I want to remember because I’ll stop “checking” to make sure it's actually saved.

8. **How do you think knowledge management will be different 5 years from now?** 10 years?

Five years from now, I think knowledge management won’t be about “apps” anymore, it’ll be invisible. Instead of asking, “Where should I save this?” the system will already know, and you’ll just create. In 10 years, I think it will evolve into more of a true “cognitive layer,” where your personal knowledge system syncs with your workflows in real time. Imagine drafting a proposal, and your system instantly surfaces every past note, idea, or conversation you’ve had that’s relevant, without you ever searching. It’ll feel less like filing cabinets and more like a living extension of your brain.

9. **What role should human curation play in future systems?** Where does AI cross the line?

Human curation is still crucial because meaning is contextual. AI can organize, tag, and even suggest priorities, but it doesn’t always understand why something matters to me. For example, I might save a messy note just because it captures the raw energy of an idea, I wouldn’t want AI “cleaning it up” and stripping out that spark. So, AI should handle structure and retrieval, while humans decide what’s sacred, what’s meaningful, and what’s worth acting on. At the same time, I think it might be beneficial, again to use the same example of my saving a messing note, for the AI to ask me additional questions or for more context on what the messy note means. That way when I refer back to it later (or when the AI is looking for relevant information to pull up in particular situations) it has that context to work with, because it wasn’t reading my mind when I was writing it and therefore doesn’t necessarily know what I was talking about in full context or big picture.

10. **How should knowledge management systems balance privacy with utility?** (cloud AI vs local processing)

I think the best systems will give users real choice. Some things I don’t mind being in the cloud, like organizing tasks or surfacing related notes, but for more sensitive stuff (personal reflections, finances, client work), I’d want the option of local or encrypted storage. The key is transparency: I want to know exactly what is stored where, and why. Too many tools hide this behind vague terms, which creates distrust. A trustworthy system will let me say, “This stays private, this can be cloud,” without compromising utility. And even anything being saved in the cloud should be encrypted and inaccessible by the host. I think about it in the way Apple or Meta (in regard to Signal or Secure Encrypted Messenger) talks about their user’s info, chat history, etc, in that even they can’t access it. This is how PKM should be approached.

### BuildOS Context & Positioning

11. **How does BuildOS's approach (brain dump → AI organization → action) fit into this future vision?**

It fits well because it matches the way people actually think. Most of us don’t start with perfect organization, we start with chaos, with raw ideas and half-finished thoughts. BuildOS embraces that reality by letting me dump everything in, then turns that chaos into clarity and, most importantly, action. It’s not just about managing knowledge, it’s about momentum. That being said, I do feel like BuildOS is built more for project management and things like goals with specific, measurable outcomes and timelines - and less as the every day to do list or task manager, and will work better for people who operate on a more regular schedule vs something more fluid and flexible.

12. **What features or capabilities would BuildOS need to fully realize this vision?**

The two big ones are frictionless capture and context-aware organization. I want to be able to capture notes however I like, text, voice, email, screenshots, and trust they’ll land in the right place. Then, I want the system to understand context deeply enough that it can connect dots for me, not just store them. It also needs strong action workflows, where notes don’t just sit, they become tasks, priorities, or even pre-built project plans.

13. **How is what we're building different from Notion AI, ChatGPT, or other AI knowledge tools?**

Most of those tools treat AI as an add-on, you still have to manually organize, and AI just helps polish or search. BuildOS is different because the core premise is action. We don’t stop at storing or retrieving knowledge; we transform it into the next step forward. That’s the leap, going from passive preservation to active execution.

14. **What makes BuildOS's focus on "action" (not just knowledge preservation) important?**

Because knowledge without action is just digital clutter. A million perfectly-tagged notes mean nothing if they never move you forward. BuildOS’s focus on action ensures the system actually drives progress. It’s not about looking at what you’ve collected, it’s about asking, “Okay, what do I do next?”

### Audience & Use Cases

15. **Who will benefit most from AI-powered knowledge management?** Who might struggle with it?

The people who’ll benefit most are those who are idea-rich but execution-poor, creators, entrepreneurs, researchers, even students juggling multiple projects. People who thrive on input but get so overwhelmed with organizing that they never end up executing. The ones who might struggle are people who are already highly rigid in their workflows and don’t want AI stepping in. If you’re obsessed with controlling every detail manually, or you already have a system that works for you, you might resist the flexibility AI introduces.

16. **How does neurodiversity (ADHD, autism, etc.) factor into future knowledge systems?**

For neurodivergent people, especially ADHD, it’s huge. Traditional systems punish you for not being consistent or linear. A good AI-powered system will adapt to your chaos, not demand you adapt to its rigidity. For example, it should handle sporadic inputs, shift priorities on the fly, and resurface forgotten notes when they’re actually relevant. That’s not just more humane, it’s more effective.

17. **What professions or roles will be most transformed by this shift?**

Knowledge-heavy roles: entrepreneurs, consultants, researchers, educators, and even creatives like writers or musicians. Anywhere ideas matter as much as execution, this kind of system is transformative. I also think corporate teams will eventually see massive change, project managers, product teams, and executives will stop wasting time in alignment meetings because their systems will already align the knowledge.

### Challenges & Concerns

18. **What are the biggest obstacles to this future happening?** Technical, social, philosophical?

Technically, context is the hardest nut to crack, getting AI to truly understand why something matters, not just what it says. Socially, adoption is tough because people resist changing their workflows, even broken ones. Philosophically, the big obstacle is trust. People need to believe their knowledge won’t be lost, misinterpreted, or exploited. That’s where transparency and user control will make or break adoption.

19. **How do we prevent AI knowledge systems from creating echo chambers or limiting thinking?**

By designing them to challenge, not just reinforce. Imagine if, alongside surfacing relevant notes, your system also surfaced contrasting ideas or alternative perspectives you’ve saved before. Or even pulled in external references you wouldn’t normally think of. Instead of narrowing your lens, it should widen it, reminding you of things you’ve forgotten or challenging your assumptions. It shouldn’t always agree with you.

20. **What's the risk of knowledge systems becoming _too_ automated?**

The risk is passivity. If the system spoon-feeds me everything, I stop exercising my own creativity and judgment. It’s like GPS: if you follow directions blindly, you never really learn the city. A healthy system should guide, not replace. It should help me act faster and smarter, but still leave room for me to wrestle with my ideas and make meaning myself.

## Questions to Strengthen the Blog

### Evidence & Examples

21. **Do you have any user stories or examples of people whose knowledge management has been transformed?** (Case studies)

22. **What research or data exists about how people actually use PKM systems?** (Usage statistics, studies)

Most studies show that people are terrible at long-term note retrieval. I’ve seen numbers saying up to 80% of notes are never looked at again after the first week. That’s wild. It means most of what we’re doing is “productivity theater.” We feel busy, but it doesn’t actually compound into usable knowledge. That’s why AI-assisted retrieval, context-linking, and surfacing forgotten info are so important, it fixes the biggest leak in the system.

23. **Are there any early indicators or trends showing this shift is already happening?** (Market signals, community discussions)

Definitely. You see it in tools like Notion adding AI, or startups like Mem and Vectal focusing on “effortless capture.” And the community chatter on Twitter, Reddit, and IndieHackers is basically one big frustration session: everyone loves shiny PKM tools but hates the overhead. The demand is clear: people want less setup, less maintenance, and more results. That’s the signal pointing toward AI-first systems becoming the norm.

### Unique Angles

24. **What contrarian or unexpected perspective can we bring to this topic?** (Something nobody else is saying)

Here’s my hot take: the goal isn’t “remember everything.” The goal is to forget strategically. Most systems try to preserve every scrap of information, but the human brain doesn’t work that way. We prune, we prioritize, we let go of what doesn’t matter. The real breakthrough will come from systems that don’t just hoard knowledge, but help you decide what not to care about. That’s contrarian, because most PKM tools sell themselves as infinite storage, but infinite storage is useless without intelligent forgetting.

25. **How does generational thinking play into this?** (Gen Z vs Millennials vs Gen X approaches to knowledge)

Millennials and Gen Z are already “multi-stream” thinkers, they’re juggling notes across social apps, chat, cloud docs. Gen Z especially doesn’t want to spend hours setting up systems - they want plug-and-play that adapts to them. Older generations, like Gen X, might still prefer rigid systems with heavy folders and structures. So future knowledge systems need to be hybrid: flexible enough for digital natives, but structured enough to onboard people who grew up on binders and file cabinets.

26. **What analogies or metaphors could make this complex topic more accessible?** (Historical comparisons, everyday examples)

### Competitive Context

27. **How should we position this relative to other "future of" predictions in the PKM space?** (Tiago Forte, Sönke Ahrens, etc.)

Tiago Forte’s “Second Brain” and Ahrens’ “Zettelkasten” are brilliant, but they assume you have the discipline to maintain them. BuildOS positions itself as the evolution of those ideas, taking the philosophy but removing the grind. We’re saying: you don’t need to become a system; you just need a system that adapts to you. That’s where we stand apart in the “future of PKM” conversation.

28. **What are Notion, Obsidian, Roam, and other major players saying about the future?**

Most of them talk about connected thought, graph databases, and infinite linking. That’s great, but it still assumes the user is the curator, the gardener. They’re still tool-first, not action-first. BuildOS says: connected thought is great, but what’s the next step? What actions, achievements, or successes are those connected thoughts producing? That’s the missing piece in the big players’ vision.

29. **Where is BuildOS leading vs following in this space?**

We’re following in the sense that we embrace capture and linking like everyone else. But we’re leading in turning that captured knowledge into a guided path of action. Everyone else stops at “you can find your notes easier.” We go further: “Here’s the next thing you should do with that note to push your project forward.”

### Actionable Takeaways

30. **What specific advice can we give readers to prepare for this shift now?** (Even without BuildOS)

Start building the habit of central capture. Even if your system is messy, funnel everything into one place. That way, when AI tools get more powerful, you already have a rich foundation to build from. Chaos in one place is still better than chaos in ten places.

31. **What should people start doing differently? What should they stop doing?**

Start: make notes actionable when possible. Add a verb or a next step to ideas so they don’t die in your archive.

Stop: spending hours on “productivity theater” - perfect tagging, elaborate folder hierarchies, color-coding every note. None of that scales.

32. **How can teams start adopting these principles today?**

Teams can start by adopting “brain dump rituals.” Instead of waiting for polished reports, encourage everyone to capture raw thoughts in one shared system. Then, layer AI on top to clean, cluster, and surface action items. The shift is from meeting-first alignment to knowledge-first alignment. Teams that practice this today will be light years ahead when AI systems mature.
