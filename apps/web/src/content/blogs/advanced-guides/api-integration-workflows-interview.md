# Blog Interview Guide: API Integration Workflows - Connecting BuildOS to Your Tech Stack

## Overview & Direction

**Blog Purpose**: Guide technical users and power users through integrating BuildOS with other tools and systems via API. Enable automation and custom workflows.

**Target Audience**: Developers, technical founders, power users comfortable with APIs, automation enthusiasts, teams wanting custom integrations

**Tone**: Technical, detailed, practical, enablement-focused, assumes some technical knowledge

**Word Count**: 2500-3500 words (technical guides can be longer)

**Key Message**: BuildOS isn't a walled garden. Use our API to integrate with your existing tools and automate your unique workflows.

### Section 4: Building Custom Workflows

**Workflow 1**: Automated Client Project Creation
**Workflow 2**: Weekly Report Generation
**Workflow 3**: Task Aggregation Dashboard
**Workflow 4**: Smart Notifications

### Section 5: Security and Best Practices

- API key management
- Rate limiting strategies
- Error handling
- Data privacy considerations
- Monitoring and logging

### Section 6: Advanced Use Cases

- Building custom dashboards
- Bulk operations
- Data export and analysis
- Custom AI integrations
- Webhooks (if supported)

### Conclusion

- API opens infinite possibilities
- Start simple, add complexity
- Community integrations and examples
- Share your integrations

## Additional Considerations

### Code Examples

- Need working code in multiple languages (JavaScript, Python, cURL)
- Should examples be copy-paste ready?
- Include error handling in examples?

### Visual Content

- Architecture diagrams (integration flows)
- Authentication flow diagram
- Data model diagram
- Example dashboard screenshots

### Technical Depth

- How technical should this be? (Assume programming knowledge?)
- Include actual API endpoint URLs?
- Show complete request/response payloads?

### SEO Keywords

- BuildOS API documentation
- productivity tool API integration
- automate task management
- API workflow automation
- custom productivity integrations

### Maintenance

- How to keep this updated as API evolves?
- Versioning strategy for blog content?

## Notes

**Audience**: This blog should serve both "show me how" users (need step-by-step) and "give me the specs" users (need technical reference).

**Practical focus**: Every section should have **working code examples**. Theory is less important than "here's how to do it."

**Community angle**: Encourage users to build and share integrations. Create a feedback loop.

**API maturity**: Be honest about current state (beta? v1? stable?) and limitations.

**Support**: Clearly indicate where to get help (docs, community, support).

**Key differentiator**: Show how BuildOS API enables workflows that aren't possible in the UI alone.
