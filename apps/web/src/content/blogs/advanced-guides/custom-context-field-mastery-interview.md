# Blog Interview Guide: Custom Context Field Mastery - Making Projects Remember What Matters

## Overview & Direction

**Blog Purpose**: Deep dive into BuildOS's custom context fields feature—how to use them effectively to capture project-specific information that makes work easier and more intelligent over time.

**Target Audience**: Power users, consultants with repeating project patterns, teams standardizing workflows, people frustrated by rigid task fields

**Tone**: Advanced but practical, emphasizes customization and flexibility, empowering

**Word Count**: 2000-2500 words

**Key Message**: Generic task fields force you into someone else's workflow. Custom context fields let you capture what actually matters for YOUR specific projects.

---

## Draft Outline Snapshot

### Introduction

- Why "priority/due date/assignee" isn't enough
- Every project has unique context needs
- Custom fields that actually serve your workflow
- How BuildOS approaches flexible context

### Section 1: Understanding Custom Context Fields

**What Are Context Fields?**

- Project-specific or task-specific metadata
- Fields that capture what matters for this work
- AI-readable context that informs decisions

**Why They Matter**:

- Reduce repetitive lookups
- Maintain consistency across tasks
- Enable smarter AI recommendations
- Build institutional knowledge

**BuildOS vs. Traditional Custom Fields**:

- Dynamic, not rigid schema
- AI can understand and use context
- Natural language, not constrained fields
- Evolves with your understanding

### Section 2: When to Use Custom Context Fields

**Good Use Cases**:

- Client projects (client name, contract details, communication preferences)
- Research (sources, methodologies, key findings)
- Creative work (style guide, brand guidelines, inspiration)
- Technical projects (dependencies, tech stack, environments)
- Recurring project types (SOPs, checklists, templates)

**Bad Use Cases** (when context isn't needed):

- One-off personal tasks
- Simple reminders
- Generic todos
- Over-engineering simple projects

### Section 3: Designing Effective Context Fields

**Principles of Good Context**:

- Specific enough to be useful
- General enough to reuse
- Easy to update
- AI-readable and human-readable

**Common Context Field Patterns**:

- Client/Stakeholder info
- Technical specifications
- Budget/Resource constraints
- Communication preferences
- Success criteria
- Reference materials
- Dependencies and blockers

### Section 4: Practical Examples by Project Type

**Consulting Projects**:

- Client context, billing details, deliverables, communication log

**Software Development**:

- Tech stack, repo links, deployment process, testing requirements

**Content Creation**:

- Target audience, tone, style guide, SEO keywords, distribution channels

**Event Planning**:

- Venue details, vendor contacts, budget breakdown, timeline, attendee info

**Research Projects**:

- Research questions, methodology, sources, findings, next steps

### Section 5: How BuildOS Uses Context Fields

**AI Integration**:

- How AI reads context to make better suggestions
- Context-aware task generation
- Smart prioritization based on context

**Search and Filtering**:

- Finding projects by context
- Grouping similar projects
- Pattern recognition across context

**Context Evolution**:

- Starting minimal, adding as needed
- Refining context over time
- Learning from past projects

### Section 6: Advanced Context Techniques

**Context Templates for Recurring Project Types**

**Context Inheritance** (if supported):

- Project-level context flows to tasks
- Phase-specific context overrides

**Collaborative Context**:

- Shared context in team projects
- Handoff information in context

**Context-Driven Automation**:

- Rules based on context fields
- Notifications triggered by context
- AI behavior adjusted by context

### Section 7: Common Mistakes and Solutions

**Mistake**: Over-specifying from the start
**Solution**: Start minimal, add as needs emerge

**Mistake**: Treating context like database fields
**Solution**: Use natural language, not rigid schema

**Mistake**: Copying context across projects blindly
**Solution**: Adapt to each project's actual needs

**Mistake**: Never updating context
**Solution**: Treat as living documentation

### Conclusion

- Context fields are your project memory
- Start simple, evolve as needed
- Let AI leverage your context
- Build your own productivity patterns

## Notes

**Key value**: Custom context fields are what make BuildOS adaptive to different work styles and project types. This is a power user feature that deserves deep exploration.

**Differentiation**: Unlike rigid custom fields in other tools, BuildOS context is AI-readable and influences intelligence, not just storage.

**Practical focus**: Heavy on templates and examples. Users should finish this blog with 5-10 context patterns they can use immediately.

**Progressive disclosure**: Start simple (basic context), then show advanced techniques. Don't overwhelm.

**Connection to brain dump**: Show how context naturally emerges from brain dumps and gets refined over time.
