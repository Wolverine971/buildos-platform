# Blog Interview Guide: Dynamic Context Feature - Projects That Learn

## Overview & Direction

**Blog Purpose**: Announce dynamic context feature, explain how BuildOS captures and evolves project context, differentiate from static note-taking.

**Target Audience**: Power users, knowledge workers, people managing complex projects, anyone frustrated by static project documentation

**Tone**: Thoughtful, technical but accessible, emphasizes intelligence and evolution

**Word Count**: 1200-1500 words

**Key Message**: Your projects should get smarter over time. Dynamic context means BuildOS understands your work better with every brain dump, every task, every update.

## Draft Outline

### Introduction: Static Notes Are Dead Information

- Traditional project notes: written once, never updated, buried
- Announcing dynamic context in BuildOS
- Projects that learn and evolve

### Section 1: The Static Context Problem

**Traditional Approaches**:

- Project documentation in wikis/docs
- Written at start, rarely updated
- Information scattered across meetings, Slack, email
- Context trapped in people's heads

**What Breaks**:

- New team members can't get up to speed
- You forget your own project context
- Knowledge doesn't compound
- Handoffs lose critical information

### Section 2: How Dynamic Context Works

**Automatic Context Building**:

- Every brain dump adds to project understanding
- Tasks contain contextual clues
- AI synthesizes scattered information
- Context evolves as project progresses

**Context Fields**:

- Flexible, project-specific metadata
- Captures what matters for THIS project
- AI-readable and human-readable
- Grows with your understanding

**AI Integration**:

- Better task suggestions based on context
- More relevant daily brief insights
- Smarter prioritization
- Pattern recognition across projects

### Section 3: Using Dynamic Context

**Creating Context**:

- Starts minimal (just project description)
- Grows through brain dumps and tasks
- Add custom context fields as needed
- Refine over time

**Accessing Context**:

- Always visible in project view
- Surfaces in task generation
- Informs daily briefs
- Searchable and filterable

**Evolving Context**:

- Update as understanding deepens
- Capture learnings and insights
- Build institutional knowledge
- Context becomes project memory

### Section 4: Use Cases

**Consulting Projects**: Client preferences, communication history, deliverable details

**Research Projects**: Methodology, sources, findings, next questions

**Product Development**: User feedback, technical constraints, design decisions

**Creative Projects**: Style guides, inspiration, brand guidelines, feedback history

### Section 5: Why This Matters

**For Individuals**:

- Never forget project details
- Return to paused projects easily
- Learn from past projects
- Build reusable patterns

**For Teams**:

- Onboard new members faster
- Handoffs maintain context
- Shared understanding
- Institutional memory

### Conclusion: Start Building Context Today

- Feature available now
- Start with one project
- Let it evolve naturally
- Share what you discover

## Notes

**Differentiation**: This is NOT just custom fields. Emphasize the "dynamic" and "AI-integrated" aspects.

**Concrete examples**: Show real project context examples across different use cases.

**Progressive disclosure**: Start simple, grow complex. Don't overwhelm.

**The "memory" angle**: Position as project memory that gets better over time.
