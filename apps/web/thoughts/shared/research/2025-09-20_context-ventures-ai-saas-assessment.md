**Date**: 2025-09-20T10:30:00-07:00
**Researcher**: DJ (using Anna's laptop)

Context Ventures has **substantial AI/SaaS expertise** that was initially underestimated. Tim Hsia personally co-founded VetraFi (a SaaS platform), the fund recently invested in HighGround (productivity software, June 2025), and Mike Steadman brings category design expertise perfect for positioning AI-native tools. They can absolutely provide strategic guidance for BuildOS's AI/SaaS development.

- [context-ventures.md](docs/marketing/investors/vc-firms/context-ventures.md) - Comprehensive fund profile showing portfolio depth

### Meeting Evolution

- Original strategy assumed future meeting (January 2025)
- DJ already met both Tim and Mike (September 2025)
- Both partners expressed interest in follow-up
- Follow-up scheduled for week of September 23, 2025

## Action Items for DJ

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Ping Tim Hsia** (week of Sept 23, 2025)
    - Reference your previous meeting
    - Mention research into their AI/SaaS portfolio
    - Specifically cite VetraFi and HighGround as relevant experience

2. **Follow up with Mike Steadman**
    - Discuss category design for AI-native productivity tools
    - Explore how BuildOS can own the "chaos to structure" category
    - Ask about The MisFits engagement model

3. **Key Messages to Emphasize**
    - BuildOS aligns with their productivity software investments (HighGround)
    - Your systematic approach matches their operational excellence thesis
    - Tim's VetraFi experience directly relevant to BuildOS scaling challenges
    - Mike's category design can help differentiate from ChatGPT/Claude

### Positioning Strategy

- Don't position as "needing" AI/SaaS guidance
- Instead, highlight synergies with their portfolio
- Reference specific portfolio companies (VetraFi, HighGround, Secureframe)
- Show you've done homework on their expertise

## Open Questions

1. What specific SaaS metrics does Tim track at VetraFi that would apply to BuildOS?
2. Has Context Ventures invested in other AI-native tools beyond those documented?
3. What's Mike Steadman's typical engagement model for category design?
4. Are they planning an AI/SaaS focused fund or maintaining generalist approach?

## Conclusion

Initial concerns about Context Ventures' AI/SaaS guidance capability were unfounded. They have:

- **Direct operational experience** (Tim building VetraFi)
- **Recent relevant investments** (HighGround productivity software)
- **Category expertise** (Mike Steadman's positioning skills)
- **Strong portfolio evidence** (Secureframe, Farther, Workflow)

Context Ventures is well-positioned to provide both capital and strategic guidance for BuildOS's AI/SaaS journey. Their combination of veteran focus, operational excellence emphasis, and actual SaaS experience makes them an ideal partner.
